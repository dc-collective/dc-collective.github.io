							<h3>
								<em>THE RETURN OF BARRY ALLEN</em>
							</h3>
							<hr />
							<p><em>My name is Wally West, and I am the fastest man alive. Well, technically there’s room for debate there, but not
									much. For the last six years, I’ve been known by another name: Kid Flash. I’ve been the hero of Blue Valley, a
									Teen Titan, I have my own museum, and best of all, I’ve gotten to fight alongside my childhood hero, my uncle,
									The Flash.</em></p>
							<p><em>A lot in my life has changed. I’ve grown a lot; I’m a senior in high school now. But I’m not slowing down. I’m
									still running, still saving the day, and loving every second of it. I’ve hit my stride. Life is perfect. And for
									the first time in a long time, I am right where I want to be.</em></p>
							<p>In front of Blue Valley Town Hall, Kid Flash stepped slowly toward the Mirror Master on the steps of the building.
								There was a crowd of onlookers standing a safe distance away from them. Kid Flash smirked, cracked his neck and bent
								over into a sprinter’s crouch. Mirror Master sneered back at him. In an instant, Kid Flash broke into a dash and
								appeared on the steps next to Mirror Master. Before the crowd could keep up, the two were already trading blows.</p>
							<p>Kid Flash gripped onto the collar of Mirror Master’s cowl and drew his fist back. He launched his blow, but before it
								could land, the Mirror Master had disappeared. Kid Flash looked around, confused. He took a step and felt something
								slippery beneath his foot-- a puddle of oil, starting from inside the doors and leaking all the way to the ground
								beyond the steps. It maintained a constant flow, as if someone or something was continuously pouring it out. What-
								or whoever it was, it had to have started before Kid Flash had gotten there. Wally wondered how he’d missed it.</p>
							<p>A hand reached out of the puddle and grabbed onto Kid Flash’s ankle, and behind it in the puddle he could see the
								Mirror Master smirking. His hand began to pull Kid Flash in, but Kid Flash leapt to the side and the Mirror Master
								lost his grip. Wally was unsettled. He had panicked for a moment when the Mirror Master had grabbed him, and he
								needed a second to catch his breath. He thought back to the puddle. It was coming from inside the building, so that
								means the Mirror Master must have been inside too. Mirror Master must’ve gone in through the back of the building
								and set up the trap before Wally had arrived.</p>
							<p>Kid Flash ran to the back of the building. There were three windows into the meeting hall, all shut and intact. It
								fit the Mirror Master’s M.O. – he could transfer himself through any reflective surface without breaking it. Kid
								Flash stepped back from the building to create distance to build momentum when he ran. He leapt into the air in a
								sprint. In the fraction of a second that he dashed at the window, everything felt slow to Wally. He had precise
								focus on the direction of his motion, letting his forward arm and leg guide him as he focused on energizing every
								molecule in his body to phase through the window. He came out the other side, made his descent to the ground, and
								kept running. He was quickly approaching the doors out of the meeting hall and focused once again on phasing through
								them.</p>
							<p>On the other side, he saw the Mirror Master next to a large, plastic oil tank, tipped onto its side. Kid Flash ran
								with full force towards him, and grabbed him as he blasted through the door. This time he hadn’t phased, and the
								doors were knocked off their hinges. Everything was nearly still-- pieces of wood were flying slowly through the air
								as Kid Flash threw the Mirror Master off the steps of the building, then went to stand next to where he calculated
								the Mirror Master was about to fall and waited there. In a second, everything went back to normal speed. Mirror
								Master hit the floor and Kid Flash stood over him, smiling victoriously. The crowd cheered as Kid Flash grabbed
								Mirror Master by the arm and made him stand up. Once again, Kid Flash had saved the day.</p>
							<p><em>God, I love my life</em> , Wally thought.</p>
							<p>In the empty West residence, keys were jangling outside the door and locks were being turned. The door finally opened
								and Wally stepped inside the house. He closed the door behind him, took off his shoes and set his backpack down next
								to them. He went into the living room and threw himself onto the couch, laying across it. He was routinely scrolling
								through his phone when he heard the landline ringing. “Who uses the landline anymore?” he grumbled, but obliged to
								stand up and pick up the phone. “Hello?”</p>
							<p>A woman’s voice came through the line. “Wally? Is that you?” It took Wally a second, but he beamed when he recognized
								the voice belonging to his favorite aunt, Iris West-Allen.</p>
							<p>“Hey, Aunt Iris!”</p>
							<p>“How’s it going, champ?” Iris asked.</p>
							<p>“Not too bad,” Wally replied. “What’s up?”</p>
							<p>“Not much to report on my end. How’s school going?” Iris asked.</p>
							<p>“Eh, it’s school. It’s way too easy.”</p>
							<p>“That means either they’re not working you hard enough or you’re not working you hard enough,” Iris advised, though
								on her end of the call she was smiling. She was proud of Wally. Wally, for his part, quietly chuckled it off. “Hey,
								are your parents home?” Iris asked him.</p>
							<p>“No, they’re out of town for the week on a business trip,” Wally answered. “Why, what’s up?”</p>
							<p>“A week? Oh.” Iris explained, “That’s okay. I was going to say that Barry’s going to be in town this week, and he
								wants to see you.”</p>
							<p>Wally perked up. “Really?”</p>
							<p>“Yeah. He’s coming in tonight, actually. We wanted to see if it was okay that he dropped by–”</p>
							<p>“Of course it is! He can stay all week if he wants.” Wally could not hide his excitement.</p>
							<p>“Yeah, well, you know I don’t like it when you’re all by yourself. I’ll let him know you extended an invitation,”
								Iris said with a chuckle. “Well, I’ll let you go, Wally. I’ll tell Barry you’re looking forward to seeing him.”</p>
							<p>“Thanks, Aunt Iris,” Wally said.</p>
							<p>“Anytime. Love you.”</p>
							<p>“I love you too.” Wally hung up the landline and went back to lay on the couch. He picked up his phone and looked at
								pictures he had of him and his uncle together as The Flash and Kid Flash, and thought over his favorite childhood
								memories: the two of them running together, over hills and through cities, fighting bad guys, and outrunning all the
								problems in the world.</p>
							<p>Wally put his phone against his chest and smiled. He could not wait to see his uncle.</p>
							<p>That night, there was a knock on the door. Wally went to open it, and sure enough the beaming face of Barry Allen was
								waiting on the other side. “Wally!” Barry exclaimed, and went in for a hug. Wally always loved Barry’s hugs. The two
								embraced each other joyfully. Finally, Barry stepped back and put his arm on Wally’s shoulder. “How’ve you been?”
							</p>
							<p>“Great,” Wally said, smiling. “How have you been? It’s been so long since I last saw you!”</p>
							<p>Barry nodded and said, “I’ve been doing all right. Every day’s a miracle, right?”</p>
							<p>“That’s right.” Wally loved when Barry said hopeful things like that. The Flash was always someone he had looked up
								to, even before he knew it was Barry. “What have you been up to lately?” Wally asked.</p>
							<p>“Oh, not much. Speedster-ing,” Barry said with a laugh. “Just the usual stuff for the Fastest Man Alive, you know how
								it is. Oh, wait…” Barry teased.</p>
							<p>Wally feigned shock and scoffed playfully. “Oh wow, okay. That’s no way to talk to Aunt Iris’ favorite.”</p>
							<p>Barry gasped and clutched his chest, pretending to have taken a deadly hit. “Touché, Wally, touché,” he said.
								“Anyways, what about you? How are things in the Wonderful World of Wallace West?”</p>
							<p>“They’re going really good. Both on the school front and the speedster front,” Wally answered.</p>
							<p>“What about on the Wally front, outside of both?”</p>
							<p>“I can’t complain,” Wally said, smiling. “Everything’s going exactly how it should be.” He felt comfort in saying
								those words. They were life-affirming to him, a word he’d seen thrown around a lot recently; even if he wasn’t quite
								sure what it meant, he felt like it applied here.</p>
							<p>Barry smiled his trademark warm smile. One look at it and anyone would feel better instantly, no matter what was
								wrong in their lives. For Wally, it just made everything feel even more perfect. “I’m a bit peckish,” Barry said.
								“Why don’t I whip us something up to eat?”</p>
							<p>“Sure! Here, let me help you,” Wally said, eager for any opportunity to work alongside his uncle. He led Barry into
								the kitchen, and the two set off, exploring the refrigerator for ingredients.</p>
							<p>After they had finished cooking the meal – a hearty steak with a side of green bean casserole – they sat down at the
								table to eat.</p>
							<p>“Were your parents saving this for a special occasion?” Barry asked with his mouth full of steak.</p>
							<p>“That’s their problem,” Wally said nonchalantly. He was not concerned at all about his parents, and in all honesty
								was glad they were away. He was happy he could relax at home without them ruining his mood.</p>
							<p>Barry finished swallowing and took a sip of water. He put the cup down and wiped his mouth. “So,” he began, “what are
								you thinking you’re gonna do in the future? Have you thought about it? Any colleges, maybe? Maybe what’s next for
								Kid Flash?”</p>
							<p>“Oh God, you’re just as bad as Aunt Iris,” Wally joked. “It’s too soon to think about all of that. I’ve applied to
								K.U. Keystone for a major in mechanical engineering, so I hope I get accepted. I’ve got a couple other schools if
								that one doesn’t work out, but honestly that’s the only school I’m seriously planning on attending. I don’t really
								want to think about if it doesn’t work out. I’m honestly just focusing on right now.”</p>
							<p>“No, it’s good to plan ahead. You should always be thinking about your future, Wally, where you want to go from
								here,” Barry advised.</p>
							<p>Wally didn’t want to think about it. He was really happy where he was, and didn’t want to worry about things
								changing. All he wanted to talk about right now was what he and Barry would be doing this next week. “Yeah, like
								what are we going to be doing now that you’re here?” he said. Another question popped up in his head: “What brought
								you to Blue Valley, anyway?”</p>
							<p>Barry was caught off guard, if only for an instant. He quickly flashed that smile, and Wally thought nothing of that
								moment. “I just wanted to see my favorite nephew,” Barry said.</p>
							<p>Wally smiled back. “Well, we could… run over the hills outside of town, just like we always do.” Wally loved these
								times with his uncle more than anything else, and preferred this option over any other. “Or we could… visit the Kid
								Flash museum.”</p>
							<p>“Let’s do that,” Barry said. “I’d love to see what the second or third fastest man alive’s been up to.”</p>
							<p>“And then after we can visit the Natural History Museum so we can see your exhibit in the fossils,” Wally quickly
								retorted. Barry snorted at that.</p>
							<p>“Alright, kid, cat’s game,” Barry said. “Let me take care of these,” he said, taking his and Wally’s empty plates to
								the kitchen to wash. “You got any ice cream?” Barry asked.</p>
							<p>“Uh, yeah.” Wally stood up and went to the freezer. He picked out his favorite, Mint Chocolate Chip, grabbed a couple
								of bowls, and walked them to the table.</p>
							<p>Barry returned from doing the dishes, and sat down in front of his bowl. “Didn’t have any Cherry Garcia?”</p>
							<p>“I don’t buy chump ice cream,” Wally joked.</p>
							<p>“Alright, well we’ll fix that tomorrow too. We’ve got a big day ahead of us, so once we’re done here, we both turn in
								for the night. After all, it’s a school night,” Barry said with that smile.</p>
							<p>“Alright.” Wally tried to keep it in, although he couldn’t help but smile back. “Save your energy, old man. We’ll get
								a race in, I’m sure.”</p>
							<p>“Maybe,” Barry said. It was all Wally needed to hear.</p>
							<p>Wally laid in his bed later that night, tired, with his eyes closed, but too excited to sleep. He was thinking about
								the week ahead of him, finally being reunited with his uncle, and that race over the hills, just like they always
								had when Barry came to town. He began to visualize what it would look like this time:</p>
							<p>The Flash and Kid Flash stood together on one of the hills outside of Blue Valley. They got into sprinters’ crouches
								and looked at each other. They both smirked, trying to taunt the other into slipping up with their confidence. They
								looked straight ahead and silently counted down:</p>
							<p><em>Three.</em></p>
							<p><em>Two.</em></p>
							<p><em>One.</em></p>
							<p><em>Zoom!</em> The two speedsters sprinted forward at great speed, running neck and neck. They both tried to speed
								past the other, but they both always pushed forward to match the other’s speed.</p>
							<p>By now, Wally was fully dreaming. Even he couldn’t see the outcome of the race, and the two kept on running. Only one
								thing was for certain: The Flash and Kid Flash were together again, and it was <em>perfect</em> .</p>
							<p>Inside a dark lounge in Central City, a man sat in a circular booth, waiting. Another man approached. “Nothing, sir,”
								the second man said. “We’ve had a lot of our guys pull jobs today, but there’s been no sign of him. We think he’s
								gone.”</p>
							<p>“Of course he is,” the first man said. “It was just like the boss predicted: The Flash would leave on this day to
								visit Blue Valley. And, if he’s right about that, then there’s someone I need to pay a visit.” The man picked up a
								strange-looking gun on the seat beside him, stood up from the booth, and left the lounge.</p>
							<p>A prison bus pulled up to Iron Heights Penitentiary, and unloaded its passengers, among whom was the Mirror Master.
								He was brought to a cell inside the prison, and the bars were slammed shut in his face.</p>
							<p>Later that evening, there was a puff of smoke down the hall from the cell, followed by a crack of lightning. Mirror
								Master stood up cautiously and peered through the bars. Around the corner of the cell block came Captain Cold,
								carrying his Cold Gun and smiling.</p>
							<p>“Hello there,” Captain Cold said. “We’re busting you out.”</p>
							<p>“‘We’?” Mirror Master asked.</p>
							<p>Captain Cold ignored him. “Stand back.” He blasted the bars with his Cold Gun until they shattered.</p>
							<p>“Why are you doing this?” Mirror Master asked.</p>
							<p>Captain Cold grinned. “There’s a new job opportunity. My employer wants to speak to you. It’s about bringing an end
								to The Flash.”</p>
