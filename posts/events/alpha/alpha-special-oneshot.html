										<p><strong>PAGE ONE – FOUR PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											Low angle on Detective JOHN JONES, shuffling down a Denver street with his
											hands in the pockets of beat-up trench
											coat. He’s wearing a fedora, bent slightly out of shape. It looks like a
											pretty rough neighborhood. The sun is
											nearly, but not quite, set behind him. Pedestrians on the street are sparse,
											but there are a few here and there,
											including a man in sunglasses and a leather jacket a ways behind John. The
											color palette should be washed out,
											almost black-and-white. John has seen a few too many Noir movies and it’s
											reflected in the visuals.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Caption] Yo, it’s Reed.</li>
											<li>REED: [Cap] There’s been a bit of a… <em>development</em> with the
												Martian.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											The man in the shades, REED to be specific, is in the foreground now,
											leaning against a wall. He’s looking at his
											phone. John is fumbling in his coat for his keys at the door to a run-down
											apartment complex in the background.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Cap] So I’m following the guy in his civilian cover, just like
												you said.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Reed is looking over at the door in shock. It’s unopened, but John has
											disappeared.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Cap] … When he rabbits, all invisible-like.</li>
											<li>REED: [Thought] Oh, <em>crap.</em> How’d he make me?</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Another shot of Reed from the street. We see the faint outline of the
											MARTIAN MANHUNTER coming into view behind him.
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Thought] Psych scramblers must not be working.</li>
											<li>REED: [Cap] A moment later, I black out.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE TWO – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											Closeup on Reed, now without sunglasses. His hair seems to be standing on
											end.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Cap] Next thing I know, I wake up…</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Pull out a little. We see the horizon <em>above</em> Reed.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Cap] … Hanging upside-down…</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Pull all the way out to a wide shot. Our view has righted itself, showing
											Reed being telekinetically dangled
											upside-down by the Martian Manhunter from the top of the Millennium Bridge.
											A train is passing beneath.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Cap] … Over a bit of a drop.</li>
											<li>MARTIAN MANHUNTER: In case you’re wondering, the only person whose
												surface thoughts I <em>can’t</em> hear is no
												less conspicuous than one I know for <em>certain</em> is following me.
											</li>
											<li>REED: Would you believe I’m just selling magazines? I’ve got a free Ko-
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Shot from the side. Reed has been pulled up so he’s face-to-face with the
											Martian Manhunter, who looks decidedly
											unamused.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>MARTIAN MANHUNTER: How did you learn my identity? Who are you working
												for?</li>
											<li>REED: [Thought] Those are questions for the whacko of a new boss, and
												I’m not giving <em>him</em> to you.
												<em>Or</em> his list.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											The same angle. Reed is putting a cigarette in his mouth.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: How about instead I tell you what else I know? I know you won’t
												kill me. I know you won’t even
												<em>hurt</em> me very much.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
											Still the same angle. Reed is lighting the cigarette with a match. The
											Martian Manhunter is reeling with the flame
											reflected in his eyes.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: And I know you won’t like <em>this.</em></li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE THREE – PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											Pull out. Reed is falling. The Martian Manhunter is shielding his face from
											the small spark.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Low angle on Reed as he lands safely on the moving train. The Martian
											Manhunter is taking off after him in the
											background.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											High angle. The Martian Manhunter is now in the foreground. Reed is pulling
											some kind of oversized gun from his
											jacket and turning to face the reader.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Wide shot from the side. Reed fires the gun, which is, in fact, a flare gun.
											The flare is arcing towards the Martian
											Manhunter.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Full shot of Reed putting the gun away as he kneels on the train roof. The
											Martian Manhunter is falling away in the
											background, his cape on fire.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Cap] I thought I’d at least made a clean getaway.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
											Closeup over Reed’s shoulder. He’s holding a small box. It’s some kind of
											electronic device. It’s been crushed and
											is sparking.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>REED: [Cap] Until I checked my psych scrambler.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE FOUR – PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											The Martian Manhunter is stamping out the flames from his cape. He’s
											speaking into a small device inscribed with the
											letters ‘JL’.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>MARTIAN MANHUNTER: Batman? J’onn. I need to meet with you as soon as
												possible. In person. We’ve had a security
												breach.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Reed is sitting in a wooden chair under a spotlight. We can’t see the
											background and the standing figure in the
											foreground is a silhouette.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>SILHOUETTE: Not to worry, Reed. We’ll just have to step up surveillance
												on the others…</li>

										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Low angle on the BATMOBILE, rocketing down a wooded road.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Closeup on the gates of ARKHAM ASYLUM.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Shot from behind JEREMIAH ARKHAM, sitting at an antique desk in a
											well-appointed office cluttered with paperwork. He
											is cradling his head in his hands.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BATMAN: [Caption] Jeremiah Arkham. Head doctor at the Asylum for the
												last three years. Direct descendent of
												founder Amadeus Arkham.</li>
											<li>BATMAN: [Cap] I don’t like him. But compared to Quincy Sharp and
												<em>especially</em> Hugo Strange before Sharp,
												Arkham’s a godsend.</li>
											<li>BATMAN: [Off-panel] What <em>happened</em> here, Arkham?</li>
											<li>ARKHAM: <em>You</em> happened. You <em>agitate</em> them.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Low angle from in front of the desk. BATMAN is standing behind Arkham,
											silhouetted by the moonlight streaming
											through the open window.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BATMAN: I wasn’t here.</li>
											<li>ARKHAM: You’re <em>always</em> here.</li>
											<li>BATMAN: I <em>appreciate</em> what you’re trying to do for your
												patients, maybe more than you’d believe, but
												even you have to understand the consequences of what happened tonight.
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
											Closeup on Batman.</p>

											<li>BATMAN: They <em>all</em> escaped, Arkham.</li>
											<li>ARKHAM: [Off-panel] Not all.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE TWO</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											A cell door, ripped off its hinges. Icy mist drifts out from the
											refrigerated cell behind it.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Another cell, this door folded over in half. The padded walls of the cell
											inside are covered in scratch marks, but
											only on half of the room.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											A third cell. Its glass walls have been shattered by coiling vines.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											The next cell’s door merely hangs open, its contents unremarkable. A guard
											is on the floor, curled in the fetal
											position and eyes wide with manic terror.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Closeup on a barred window in a metal door. The cell inside is dark, but we
											can see the glint of a huge smile full
											of yellow teeth in the shadows.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>JOKER: I didn’t know you cared.</li>
											<li>BATMAN: [Off-panel] I only care that you never see the light of day
												again.</li>
											<li>JOKER: Aren’t you even curious why I didn’t bust out with all the other

											<li>BATMAN: [Off-panel] A little.</li>

										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE THREE</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											The JOKER, straitjacketed, steps into the light.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BATMAN: [Cap] The Joker. Arguably the <em>worst</em> of the Arkham
												inmates.</li>
											<li>JOKER: Come on, Batsy, I don’t need those other losers cramping my
												style. I just gave ‘em a little
												encouragement, inspired by some light reading material, and curled back
												up in home, sweet home.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Outside the cell, Batman turns to look at Arkham, who offers up a magazine.
										</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Closeup on the magazine as Batman takes it. It is entitled “KONING
											KATALOGUE,” and the cover displays a variety of
											merchandise branded with Batman logos, including t-shirts and baseball caps.
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CATALOGUE COVER: PAGE ELEVEN – All WayneTech Computers on SALE!</li>
											<li>BATMAN: [SFX] Hmm.</li>
											<li>JOKER: [Off-panel] Eddie and the other nerds planned the details, but I
												got ‘em hankering for that sweet, sweet
												merch. Say, you ever consider hiring a promoter, Bats?</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Closeup on Arkham, pointing at Batman accusingly.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>ARKHAM: You see what you <em>do</em> to them?</li>

										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											We see them from the side. Arkham is about two feet shorter than Batman.
											Batman is stepping towards his finger,

										<p>
											<em>4 panels.</em>
										</p>
										<div class="panel">
											<h5><em>PANEL ONE</em></h5>
												<p>
												Full-width exterior wide shot of a small BROWNSTONE in GOTHAM CITY. It’s
												small but cozy, and in generally good
												condition. Not a luxury condo, but given Gotham property prices,
												whoever’s paying rent presumably has reasonable
												expendable income, or at least a parent who does.</p>
											<h5><em>PANEL TWO</em></h5>
												<p>
												⅓ width, interior wide shot of the brownstone’s first floor entryway.
												The floor is slightly scuffed hardwood. A
												pair of small women’s black BOOTS lies haphazardly on the floor. The
												doorway to the KITCHEN is to the right. The
												interior can’t be seen from this angle, but SMOKE trails from inside, as
												does a dialogue bubble:</p>
											<p class="dialogue">VIDEO (OFFSCREEN)<br />
												Now, when the edges are set and you see about 5 or so bubbles on the
												inside, you’ll want to flip it…</p>
											<h5><em>PANEL THREE</em></h5>
												<p>
												⅓ width. Wide interior shot of the brownstone’s kitchen. CASSANDRA CAIN,
												seen from the back, stands at the
												kitchen’s stove. A FRYING PAN is on the stove in front of her. Smoke is
												visibly coming from the pan. She is
												frying on high. Scattered around her is an entire mess of DIRTIED
												KITCHEN UTENSILS. The frying pan in front of
												her contains a charcoal briquette that might once have had the potential
												to become a pancake. A TABLET is
												propped up next to her.</p>
											<h5><em>PANEL FOUR</em></h5>
												<p>
												⅓ width. Close-up on the tablet. It’s playing a cooking video. The
												smiling woman on the screen demonstrates how
												to cook a pancake.</p>
											<p class="dialogue">WOMAN<br />
												Now, once you’ve flipped, you’re going to want to give it another minute
												or so before it’s ready to serve.</p>

												It’s a voice assistant. It hooks into all your files. You can ask it if

												Open on a close-up of a PHONE SCREEN. It’s an Android type layout but is
												definitely legally not any form of
												Android. Text at the top of it reads KENSING. The screen itself is open
												on the Gotham News Network main page.
												The top story reads MASS ARKHAM BREAKOUT. An ad in the sidebar shows a
												woman wearing a RED DRESS. Small text at
												the bottom reads BROUGHT TO YOU BY KONING ADS :crown:&quot;.</p>

												dark hair, dark eyes, a black denim
												jacket and a red newsboy cap. Luis stands to Jo’s side with his arms
												folded, peering down at the phone screen in
												her hand. They are inside the RED HOOD HEADQUARTERS, which is mostly
												just a glorified refurbished old warehouse.

											<em>Four panels.</em>
										</p>
										<div class="panel">
											<p>PANEL ONE
												Full-width panel. Wide exterior shot of the outside of JESSICA CRUZ’S
												APARTMENT BUILDING. It looks fairly
												normal, your general apartment building.</p>
											<p class="dialogue">JESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
												So, this is uncomfortably familiar.</p>
											<p>PANEL TWO
												Full-width panel. Wide interior medium shot of Jessica Cruz’s apartment.
												It’s a studio style. All the furniture
												is in place, but there are still a few half-unpacked cardboard boxes
												lying around, indicating that the owner has
												moved in somewhat recently. There are also a number of takeout boxes,
												dirty clothes, and other assorted detritus
												of living scattered around, indicating that the owner hasn’t moved in
												<em>that</em> recently, and is apparently
												a slow unpacker.</p>
											<p class="dialogue">JESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
												Only been living here 3 months, and already, I’m a shut-in. Haven’t left
												my apartment in two weeks.</p>
											<p>PANEL THREE
												Medium shot of Jessica at her computer desk, a laptop set up in front of
												her. There’s like ten empty soda cans
												on her desk. Her eyes are on her screen but semi-unfocused, her head
												resting on one hand, her right hand on her
												touchpad.</p>
											<p class="dialogue">JESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
												This time, it wasn’t my decision. I got exposed to some type of weird
												alien virus on my last mission. They let
												me go home when I didn’t show any symptoms, but they still told me not
												to go out, just in case.</p>
											<p>PANEL FOUR
												Close-up of Jessica’s screen. She’s looking over some type of infinite
												scroll clickbait site entitled GROUCHY
												CAT CENTRAL. There are a number of entries with various cat pictures.
												They all look extremely grumpy and
												extremely adorable. Her scrollbar is about the size of a pinhead.
												Several ads are scattered around the page on
												the left and right sidebars and between posts. One’s for HOME SECURITY
												SYSTEMS, one’s for CHILLAX EMPIRE:
												WORLD’S MOST RELAXING STRATEGY GAME, one’s for an emerald ring from
												WILL’S JEWELERS, and one’s for a POKEMON GO
												FRIEND FINDER. All of the ads have “BROUGHT TO YOU BY KONING ADS
												:crown:” at the bottom.</p>
											<p class="dialogue">JESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
												So here I am, on my last day of quarantine. Falling back into old bad

										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											NIGHTWING, in his costume and a helmet, is riding his motorcycle. We see him
											from behind, chasing a group of five
											men also on motorcycles, led by THRILLDEVIL. The street is the SPINE, a wide
											thoroughfare through the middle of
											Blüdhaven, lined with gaudy casinos. Thrilldevil has a large duffel bag over

											<li>HALY: [Rec] Anyway, it could be just the shot in the arm the old circus

											Move back in front of Nightwing. He’s dropped the grapnel gun and is riding

										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Shot from ORACLE’s desk in the CLOCKTOWER. BARBARA GORDON, also known as
											ORACLE, is in the foreground, rubbing her
											temple. In the background, Dinah is facing away, into the kitchen, her fists
											on her hips.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>DINAH: It’s been a <em>month</em> since I visited you.</li>
											<li>BABS: Dinah…</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Zoom in on the kitchen. It is piled with empty cardboard boxes</p>
										<ol>
											<li>DINAH: <em>No one</em> can eat this many TV dinners in a month. It’s
												<em>inhumane.</em></li>
											<li>BABS: [Off-panel] <em>Dinah.</em></li>
											<li>DINAH: Seriously? The least you could do is actually take your trash out
												and <em>spare</em> me this gruesome
												spectacle.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Full shot of Babs, turning her wheelchair around to face Dinah. One of her
											monitors has a webpage open, featuring
											fuzzy images of a pale man in a dark suit. The other has a sparse,
											commercial-looking page that says KONING
											INDUSTRIES on a banner at the top.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: I’m <em>busy,</em> Dinah.</li>
											<li>DINAH: [Off-panel] Not too busy to come eat something fit for human
												consumption with me.</li>
											<li>BABS: I think this cloud storage service is <em>following</em> me.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Dinah has her arms folded, unimpressed.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>DINAH: <em>Cloud</em> storage? <em>Following</em> you? No. That can
												wait. That really good <em>seafood
													place,</em> Babs. We’re going. Now.</li>
											<li>BABS: [Off-panel] This is <em>serious.</em> The chances that
												<em>every</em> system I’ve broken into in the last
												three months would be using the <em>same</em> provider are
												statistically-</li>
											<li>DINAH: We’re. Eating. Shrimp.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE TWO – EIGHT PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											Babs and Dinah are sitting across from each other in a restaurant. You’ll
											never guess what they’re eating.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>DINAH: This is the part where you thank me for coaxing you out of your
												<em>cave.</em></li>
											<li>BABS: Ouch. I probably had that coming, but ouch.</li>
											<li>DINAH: And <em>now</em> that we’ve addressed the crisis of what you’re
												<em>eating,</em> I want to know what’s
												eating <em>you.</em></li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Closeup on Babs, mid-bite, shrugging.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: Mmfine.</li>
											<li>DINAH: [Off-panel] You’re not fine, you’re having panic attacks over
												seeing too many <em>Google Docs</em> . Is
												this about <em>Helena?</em></li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Babs swallows.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: [SFX: Gulp.] <em>That’s</em> in the past. For <em>one</em> of us,
												anyway.</li>
											<li>DINAH: <em>I</em> for one still have no clue what happened, which
												reminds me that you’re also doing the
												keeping-secrets-for-no-reason thing. Are we going to have to break out
												your old Batsuit? Give it some angry
												white lenses and a grey paintjob?</li>
											<li>BABS: All right, all right, you’ve made your point. There’s just a lot
												going on right now.</li>
											<li>DINAH: So <em>spill.</em></li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Establishing shot of ARKHAM ASYLUM.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: [Cap] Well, <em>first</em> there’s this whole Arkham breakout.
												Something smells about that.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Several figures are seated around a table in a dark room. SARGE STEEL and
											GENERAL WADE EILING have sprung to their
											feet and are pointing fingers at one another. AMANDA WALLER is seated in the
											foreground, turning towards the reader
											with a suspicious glance. A silhouetted figure is lounging in the
											background.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: [Cap] My shady government sources are convinced there’s a big
												shakeup going on in Washington, but nobody
												seems to know what it <em>is</em> or who’s <em>causing</em> it.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
											A building resting on a snow-capped mountain. Its windows are dark.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: [Cap] I’ve lost contact with informants on a potential trouble
												spot in Switzerland.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Seven</strong><br />
											A world map. Black dots of varying sizes are scattered somewhat evenly
											across the various continents.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: [Cap] There’s been a <em>really</em> weird swell in criminal
												organizations with way, <em>way</em> more
												money than they should have.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Eight</strong><br />
											Back to the two-shot at the restaurant.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: <em>And</em> something keeps setting off my proximity sensors in
												the maintenance tunnels under the
												Clocktower.</li>
											<li>DINAH: Well, geez, I can help with <em>some</em> of that. What needs
												roundhouse kicking?</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE THREE – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											The scene has moved back to the Clocktower. We’re looking at the tinted
											glass of the clock face from inside. We can
											see the city skyline outside. We also see faint reflections of Babs, sitting
											close to the clock face and staring
											pensively outwards, and Dinah, leaning against a wall and looking at Babs.
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: I actually <em>was</em> planning to have you look into the weird
												crime rings.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Reverse the previous panel. We’re looking in from the outside, and the
											skyline is reflected. Dinah is reaching
											curiously towards something outside our view.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: And I <em>do</em> have other operatives I can assign to the rest-
											</li>
											<li>DINAH: Hey, what’s this?</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Dinah is holding up a mask, shaped like Oracle’s symbol.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>DINAH: Are you making an official Oracle costu-</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Babs yanks the mask out of Dinah’s hands.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: <em>Don’t touch that!</em></li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Closeup of Dinah, looking surprised and a little hurt.</p>
										<p><strong>PAGE FOUR – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											Closeup of Babs, holding the mask. She seems almost as surprised by what she
											did as Dinah is.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>BABS: It’s… experimental. A VR headset thing. Just really fragile.</li>
											<li>BABS: [Quietly] Sorry.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Dinah leans in close and puts a hand on Babs’ shoulder. Her brow is
											furrowed. Babs is still staring at the mask in
											her hands.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>DINAH: You’ve always been high-strung, but this <em>isn’t normal,</em>
												even for you. If this <em>is</em> just
												stress, <em>take a break.</em> Visit your dad or something.</li>
											<li>BABS: You’re… you’re right.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Shot from Babs’ POV. She’s looking up at Dinah, who has her hands on her
											hips. Dinah is smiling, but hesitantly.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>DINAH: As usual.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Babs and Dinah are by the door. Dinah is holding it open with her foot. The
											mask is resting in Babs’ lap, her hands
											wrapped over it protectively.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>DINAH: Just promise me you’ll take care of yourself.</li>
											<li>BABS: I <em>will.</em> And really, I’m just exhausted. I shouldn’t take
												it out on you, but I’ll be perfectly
												fine.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Dinah is gone. The door swings shut. Babs is focused on the mask again.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>SFX: Click.</li>
											<li>BABS: God, I <em>hate</em> lying to her.</li>
										</ol>

										<p><strong>PAGE ONE – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											A vintage fighter plane, a World War II-era P-38 Lightning to be specific,
											is flying through the air, the sun
											glinting across the cockpit.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “Funny story.”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											A pick-up truck is parked at the edge of a clearing in the woods. A gravel
											road stretches back into the forest. A
											man is leaning against it, mostly off-panel.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “So, a guy gets a call from his doctor.”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Another angle on the Lightning, this time from the wing.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “He asks what it’s about, of course.”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Closeup on the man. He appears to be no older than his mid-thirties, but has
											silvery-white hair, with a short beard.
											He has a distant expression.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “And the doctor tells him ‘I have good news and bad news. Which
												do you want to hear first?’”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											High angle of the Lightning, through the whirring propeller blades of
											something next to the reader.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “So the guy says, ‘Alright, let’s hear the good news.’”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE TWO – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											Angle from behind the Lightning as the propellered craft sweeps past it. The
											other craft is a small DRONE. Aside
											from the clear anachronism, the drone also appears to be <em>larger</em>
											than the Lightning.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “And the doctor says ‘You have only twenty-four hours to
												live.’”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Extreme closeup on the man’s hands. He is holding a model airplane
											controller.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “Now the guy’s pretty upset by this, right? He says ‘My God!
												You call that <em>good</em> news?’”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Extreme closeup on the man’s face. He is squinting.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “So the doctor says ‘The bad news is…’”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Extreme closeup on the drone. On the side is the name “KONING.”</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: “‘… I’ve been trying to reach you since yesterday!’”</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Even closer on the man’s eyes. They are GLOWING.</p>
										<p><strong>PAGE THREE – TWO PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											The drone explodes from a bolt of force shooting up from below. We can see
											some debris hitting the model Lightning
											in the background.</p>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											A viewscreen in a dark room. It is displaying static. A smaller screen next
											to it is showing a closeup of the man
											from above, presumably captured by the drone before its untimely demise.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>UNKNOWN: [Off-panel] We’ve found him.</li>

										<ol>
											<li>CAPTION: Koning Industries headquarters, Virginia.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>PAGE TWO – PANELS</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
											Two silhouetted figures, one male and one female, are seated in front of a
											large array of viewscreens. They show
											various scenes from the vignettes and rotate through them as the scene
											continues.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>FEMALE UNKNOWN: So, what do you think?</li>
											<li>MALE UNKNOWN: Sloppy operation. Several of them know <em>far</em> too
												much.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
											Closeup on Female Unknown.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>FEMALE UNKNOWN: The boys in Analysis don’t think any of them represent
												more than a Level 4 Operational Threat.
											</li>
											<li>MALE UNKNOWN: [Off-panel] The boys in Analysis are idiots, then.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
											Closeup on Male Unknown. He’s turned back to the screens.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>MALE UNKOWN: I’m primarily worried about J’onn and the good Captain.
											</li>
											<li>FEMALE UNKNOWN: [Off-panel] Not Batman or Oracle?</li>
											<li>MALE UNKNOWN: They’re… being dealt with already.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
											Male Unknown turns back to Female Unknown. He’s looking at something roughly
											cylindrical in his hand. She’s standing
											up from a table where they were sitting across from each other.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>FEMALE UNKNOWN: And what are your orders for the other two? Don’t tell
												me you mean to terminate them.</li>
											<li>MALE UNKNOWN: Of course not. They’re friends. But have people on standby
												to terminate if I give the order.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
											Closeup on a checkerboard pattern on the table.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>MALE UNKNOWN: [Off-panel] And one other thing: Start the
												<em>auctions.</em></li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
											The same angle. A chess piece, the BLACK KING, is thrown down onto the
											table.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>MALE UNKNOWN: The game has begun. It’s time we made our first play.</li>
											<li>CAPTION: To be continued in OMEGA!</li>
