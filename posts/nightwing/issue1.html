								<em>THE FALL OF BLÜDHAVEN PART I: BLÜD IN THE WATER</em>
							</h3>
							<hr />
							<p><strong>PAGE ONE – SPLASH</strong></p>
								<p>Wide shot of the Blüdhaven skyline at sunset from the north. We can see the gaudy lights of the casinos along the
								Boardwalk to the left and down the Spine, which proceeds inland at ninety degrees from the Boardwalk. The industrial
								grit of Melville and the urban decay of the Zee Moors are visible on the far side of the Spine, while the humbly
								dignified antiquity of Baily Church’s outdated architecture sprawls closer to the reader. In the foreground,
								NIGHTWING is diving head-first from the roof of Baily Church’s eponymous cathedral, illuminated by multicolored
								light from the large stained glass window in the church’s façade, which faces the ocean.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Caption] My city.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Funny, never thought <em>I’d</em> be using that line.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TWO – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>A large panel taking up most of the page, a small insert, and a row of three.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Low angle from the south as Nightwing catches himself with a grapnel line and swings forward, a wide grin on his
								face.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] That’s usually more Batman’s thing.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Oh, I used to work for him, by the way. You probably knew me as Robin back then.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Extreme closeup of Nightwing’s foot touching down on a roof.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								High angle from behind Nightwing as he crouches on the corner of a low rooftop.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] I struck out on my own, found a new family, lost it, found it again, lost it <em>again</em> ,
									and then I fell in love.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Low angle again. Nightwing is leaping off the roof, grapnel gun once again in hand.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Not with a woman—not that I <em>haven’t</em> done <em>that</em> two or three times—with a
									<em>city</em> . My city. <em>This</em> city.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Nightwing zips along the street with his grapnel line. The buildings are blurred from the speed.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Blüdhaven. Ugly name for an ugly town. But it needs a hero and I’m here for it.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE THREE – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Panel One is set into the top left corner of Panel Two. Then a row of two and a wide panel.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Closeup of DICK GRAYSON, in his police uniform, holding out a pair of handcuffs.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] I consider it a full-time job.</li>
								<li>CAPTION: Earlier today.</li>
								<li>DICK: You have the right to remain silent…</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								We pull out to see an empty, graffiti-covered parking garage. Afternoon light streams in from outside. Dick and the
								man he’s arresting are next to a beat-up red sedan, its trunk open and full of guns. A second car, this one black
								but in similar condition, is parked to the right. A second criminal is sprawled on the ground near the red car,
								unconscious. A third is leaning against the black car, nursing a broken jaw. A fourth is being shoved by a scowling
								AMY ROHRBACH, also in uniform.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>AMY: <em>Please</em> exercise it.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] That’s my partner, Amy Rohrbach. One of the <em>other</em> five or so honest cops in BPD. She’s
									always been… <em>intense</em> , but she’s been particularly on edge since I got back from my last leave.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Closeup on Dick cuffing his perp.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: <em>Easy</em> , Sarge. These guys are more than done.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Mirrored closeup on Amy doing the same.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>AMY: Don’t- [SFX: Huff] You’re right. Let’s just bring them in.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Two-shot. Amy is sitting at a desk, frowning at a stack of paperwork. Dick is leaning against the wall to the right,
								feet crossed. They’re both holding Styrofoam cups with steam drifting out of them. Next to Dick is a window.
								Outside, we can see that the sun is getting low in the sky, but not set.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: You doing all right, Amy?</li>
								<li>AMY: Fine.</li>
								<li>DICK: Well, if you don’t need anything else, I’ve got sort of an appointment.</li>
								<li>AMY: I drew short straw on paperwork anyway.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE FOUR – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Two-by-three grid.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Low angle from behind Dick. He’s approaching his apartment building, a humble three-story brick building on a street
								of similar structures. Closer to the door is the hulking figure of AARON HELZINGER, dressed in his prison guard’s
								uniform.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] That’s my building, by the way.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Not a turn of phrase, either. I had to buy it to save it from demolition. <em>Long</em> story.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Pull up and in a little as Dick passes Aaron and the two wave to each other.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>AARON: Hello, Mister Grayson.</li>
								<li>DICK: Aaron.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Aaron Helzinger used to be called Amygdala. Weird being neighbors with a supervillain, but he’s
									a sweet guy when he’s on his meds. Works up at the penitentiary these days.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Inside, Dick begins to ascend the stairs. DAVE TOUSSANT leans out from a ground-floor door to wave.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DAVE: ‘Evening, Dick.</li>
								<li>DICK: Hey, Dave. How’s the little one?</li>
								<li>DAVE: Just fine, thanks for asking.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] That’s Dave Toussant, the new super. My… <em>other half</em> helped him and his daughter Kesia
									out of a jam a while back.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								At the top of the stairs, Dick bumps into JOHN LAW.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: Sorry, Mister Law. Wasn’t looking where I was going.</li>
								<li>JOHN: I think I can still take a couple bumps, son.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] And the tour ends with Jonathan Law, formerly known as the Tarantula. Novelist turned superhero
									turned novelist again.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								We finally follow Dick into his own apartment, clearly cheap, but neat and well-maintained. He’s taking off his hat
								and jacket. The sun still hasn’t quite set, but it’s close.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] There’s still time before dark.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								We finally move back around to his front as Nightwing swings away from the window.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] But hey, I never minded a little sunlight.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE FIVE – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Establishing shot, a row of two, and a row of three.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								High angle from behind Nightwing, crouching on a rooftop. It’s night, and the moon is beginning to rise. Below is a
								warehouse. On the far side of the warehouse are the docks. It’s austere, but not abandoned. Two men in dark
								clothing, CRIMINAL 1 and CRIMINAL 2, are moving a large crate to a truck parked on the street. A third, CRIMINAL 3,
								is holding the door open.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>CAPTION: Now.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] An informant heard about this job through the grapevine.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Nightwing is now kneeling on the street side of the truck. We can see Criminal 1 and Criminal 2 with the crate
								approaching from behind.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] But it’s like a game of Telephone – the more people the info passed through to reach me, the
									more garbled it is. I need to take a closer look before I make any moves.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Closeup of Criminal 1 peering around the corner of the truck.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Low angle, pulled out a little. Nightwing is hiding on the roof.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Who <em>are</em> these guys, anyway? Too white to be Madame Minh’s, and the <em>big guy</em>
									would send some costumed muscle for a job this size.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Shot from the roof of the warehouse. Nightwing is pulling himself up.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] I mean, he could at <em>least</em> spare Brutale or Electrocutioner.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								Nightwing is looking through the skylight. It’s dark inside, but we can see rows of shelves with similar crates on
								them. CRIMINAL 4 and CRIMINAL 5 are removing one.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] This looks like a pickup, not a burglary. But how would an independent crew get involved in a
									smuggling operation like this?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE SIX – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Two-by-three grid.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Wide shot of Criminal 3 holding the door open. Behind him, Nightwing’s hand is reaching out of the darkness.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Let’s find out.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Criminal 3’s legs are kicking out of the door as he’s pulled back into the dark.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Shot from the floor, next to a brown dress shoe, angled up at Criminal 4 and Criminal 5, still pulling a crate out
								from the shelf.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Two-shot between Criminal 4 and Criminal 5. The shoe belongs to a man in a trench coat and a fedora, his face
								obscured in shadow. He’s jerking a thumb over his shoulder and the two criminals are drawing knives from their
								belts.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Nightwing has Criminal 3 in a chokehold in the corner.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Alright, friend. I think it’s time for a-</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								Nightwing looks up, his eyes widening.</p>
							<p><strong>PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Two rows of two and a wide panel.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Pull back and to the right a little as Criminal 4 lunges from the left and embeds his knife in the wall. Nightwing
								is dodging to the right.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Closeup on Criminal 4’s face as Nightwing kicks him in the jaw.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: Isn’t this usually the part where you say “Not so fast, masked man!” –</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Pull back out. Criminal 3 is slumped in the corner. Criminal 4 is sprawling and holding his jaw. Nightwing is
								kicking Criminal 5’s knife out of his hand.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: – Or maybe, “I’ll get him, boss!”?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Move back in behind Nightwing as he delivers a right hook to Criminal 5’s face.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: Henchmen are just no <em>fun</em> anymo-</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								A crate lands on top of Nightwing from above.</p>
							<p><strong>PAGE EIGHT – FOUR PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Each panel is full-width.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Low angle. Nightwing is lying face-down. The crate has fallen over onto its side and the lid has flown off. We can
								see that it’s full of assault rifles. CRIMINAL 6 is kneeling on top of the shelf the crate fell from. Criminal 2 is
								leaning through the door.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Well, that hurts. A lot.</li>
								<li>CRIMINAL 2: The hell happened in here?!</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Show Criminal 2 on the left and Criminal 6 on the right from behind, dragging Nightwing by the arms between two
								shelves towards their mysterious LEADER, who is facing an open loading door facing the docks.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Woozy. Head is pounding.</li>
								<li>CRIMINAL 2: You idiot. If you damaged the merchandize, the boss’ll skin you alive.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Hey, they <em>did</em> mention “the boss.”</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Angle from above as Nightwing is pulled up behind the leader.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>LEADER: I thought it might be you snoopin’ around…</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Closeup from the side as the leader leans backwards towards Nightwing. He’s wearing a neck brace and a set of
								high-tech goggles that wrap around to the back of his head. This probably has something to do with the fact that is
								head is facing 180 degrees from the rest of his body. This is TORQUE.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>TORQUE: <strong><em>… Lad!</em></strong></li>
							</ol>
							<p>2 .NIGHTWING: Torque!</p>
							<p><strong>PAGE NINE – THREE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>The panels are arranged with two on top and one on the bottom. The lines form an upside-down “Y” shape, sort of like
								a peace sign.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Shot over Nightwing’s shoulder; he’s still being restrained. Torque has stepped forward (away) a little and thrown
								his arms wide.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Makes sense. He broke loose recently and went to ground. Maybe hooking back up with his
									Intergang buddies?</li>
								<li>TORQUE: Surprised t’ <em>see</em> me, Boyo?</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: If this is a set-up for a “hindsight” pun, save it. I figured you’d be back…</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								The same angle. The two criminals holding Nightwing start convulsing, with some electrical sparks flying. Nightwing
								is catching Torque in the nose with a high kick.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>TORQUE: [SFX] Uhn!</li>
								<li>SFX: BZZT! BZZT!</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: … And it looks like <em>my</em> turn to disappear!</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] <em>Assuming</em> I can actually pull this off.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] [Next to Criminal 2] Microtasers built into telescoping collapsible Escrima sticks stowed in my
									gauntlet compartments.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] [Next to Criminal 6] Short version, my stick thingies go <em>zap</em> and so do my hands now.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Shot from in front of Nightwing as he makes a break for the door to the docks. In the background, Torque has risen
								to his knees and is reaching into his coat.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] That box took a lot out of me. I should be faster than—</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TEN – SPLASH</strong></p>
								<p>Low angle. Nightwing is stumbling and yelling at the edge of the dock. Torque has pulled out a huge revolver and
								fired three times. We see the paths of the bullets. One is passing over Nightwing’s right shoulder and another under
								his left arm, but the third is punching directly through his left shoulder.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>SFX: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE ELEVEN – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Panel One is a splash, so to speak. The remaining panels are wide and short, stacked one on top of the other beneath
								Panel One.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Shot from underwater as Nightwing falls in, head-first. Blood is pooling out from his shoulder wound.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								View from the surface. We see an extreme closeup of Nightwing’s face as he floats to the surface. He’s unconscious.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Our view stays in place as Nightwing is carried away by the current. It brings him out to a closeup…</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								… A wide shot…</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								… And a speck in the distance.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>TITLE: THE FALL OF BLÜDHAVEN PART I – BLÜD IN THE WATER</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TWELVE – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>A row of two, a large panel, and another row of two.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Extreme closeup on Dick. He’s asleep, but no longer in the water.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								He wakes with a gasp.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Dick sits up. He’s in a bedroom, nicer than his apartment but significantly more cluttered. A few personal articles
								(mostly books) are piled in a corner in a hasty attempt at cleaning. A nightstand next to the bed has a digital
								clock and a few pictures on it, but they’re facing away from us. He’s shirtless, bandages wrapped around his injured
								shoulder. A neatly-folded stack of clothes rests at the foot of the bed. There’s a note on top of them.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Where the hell-?</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Oh, I <em>do</em> know this place. But how did I <em>get</em> here?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Closeup on Dick’s hand holding the note. It’s handwritten.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NOTE: Pretty sure these are your size. Your <em>other</em> clothes are drying. And have a <em>hole</em> in them.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								We see over his shoulder as he turns to look at the nightstand. One of the photos is of Dick himself, smiling
								sheepishly in his police uniform. Another is of a young BARBARA GORDON embracing her father, JIM GORDON. The third
								features Barbara, somewhat older and in a wheelchair, next to DINAH LANCE, who has her arm around Barbara’s
								shoulders in what appears to be an uncomfortably tight squeeze. The clock reads 10:47 PM.</p>
							<p><strong>PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>A large establishing shot, a row of three, and a row of two.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Dick’s leaning in the bedroom door. Outside, we see the interior of the CLOCKTOWER. Aside from the gears of the
								clock, the apartment is fairly ordinary, if more spacious than typical, and with most of the furniture piled with
								miscellaneous books and paperwork. Electrical wires crisscross along the walls, attached by tape. On the far side, a
								set of computer monitors are attached to a large desktop machine. Using the computer is Barbara. She’s turning in
								her wheelchair to face Dick.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: Alright, I give up. How’d I get here?</li>
								<li>BARBARA: You’re awake!</li>
								<li>DICK: Which I’m guessing means it’s <em>not</em> still Wednesday.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Closeup on Barbara, hands folded in her lap.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BARBARA: Early this morning, I saw your suit tracer in Gotham, out in the middle of Rogers Yacht Basin. I
									couldn’t get through, so I figured something was wrong and sent Robin to fish you out.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Closeup on Dick.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: Well, thank goodness for Big Brother.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								The same angle. Barbara’s stuffed Nightwing doll is hitting Dick in the head.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Wide shot of the kitchen. Barbara is pouring coffee into a pair of mugs on the kitchen table. Dick is moving a
								hefty-looking computer parts catalogue off of a chair nearby.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: I think the shirt’s a size too small, by the way.</li>
								<li>BARBARA: Believe me, I <em>noticed</em> .</li>
								<li>BARBARA: Seriously, how are you?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								Another closeup on Dick, rubbing his shoulder.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: Doesn’t hurt too bad, other than my pride, my sleep schedule, and- <em>Ow!</em> -my shoulder.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE FOURTEEN – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>One column.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Two-shot of Dick and Barbara across the table from one another.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BARBARA: What happened, anyway?</li>
								<li>DICK: Routine mission. Just took a couple lucky shots.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Closeup of Barbara. She has a concerned frown on her face.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BARBARA: Just be careful, all right? It can be easy to forget how… <em>fragile</em> we are.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								The same two-shot from Panel One. They’re both staring down into their mugs.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Pull in a little as Barbara moves around the table to place a hand on Dick’s shoulder.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BARBARA: Hey. Hey! <em>No moping.</em> I’ll do that on my <em>own</em> time. I’m just glad you’re all right.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Pull in just a little more as Dick holds her hand and smiles at her.</p>
							<p><strong>PAGE FIFTEEN – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>A row of three, a row of two, and a row of one.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Closeup on Barbara.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BARBARA: How soon do you have to get home?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Closeup on Dick, smiling apologetically.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: I missed a day of work already. If I go tonight, I can still grab a couple hours of sleep before I go in
									tomorrow.</li>
								<li>DICK: Unless you need me here?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Closeup on their hands.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BARBARA: I certainly wouldn’t <em>mind</em> your staying over… but Bruce needs me on standby. The Dynamic Duo
									are looking into this thing* at Gothcorp.</li>
								<li>CAPTION: *A “thing” detailed in the all-new smash Batman #1 – read it today! – Self-PromotingJamags</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Another closeup of Dick, pulled in a little tighter than the last.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: Maybe I <em>should</em> stay a while. For… luck.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Two-shot. Dick and Barbara kiss.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								The same angle. They’ve pulled apart, smiling.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BARBARA: I feel luckier already.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE SIXTEEN – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Two-by-three grid. The borders are somewhat blurred, indicating a flashback.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								BATGIRL is running towards the reader along a rooftop. BATMAN is swinging in from the upper left, and ROBIN from the
								upper right. Their poses imitate the cover of Detective Comics #359, but with Batman further away and slightly
								blurred.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] When the Batgirl first showed up, I guess I developed sort of a kiddie crush on her. She was a
									little old for me and I honestly didn’t even think she knew.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] My first mistake. Babs knows <em>everything</em> .</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								The TEEN TITANS are posing for a photograph. AQUALAD and SPEEDY are in the back, standing. Speedy is holding two
								fingers up behind Aqualad’s head, and Aqualad is glaring at him. Robin is kneeling in the front, with his arms
								around the shoulders of WONDER GIRL and KID FLASH, also kneeling.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] We fell out of contact after I first joined the Titans.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								A similarly-framed shot of the NEW TEEN TITANS. In the back, JERICHO is waving, RAVEN’s arms are folded dignifiedly
								behind her back, and CYBORG is grabbing CHANGELING by the wrist, preventing him from imitating Speedy’s maneuver
								from the previous panel. Kneeling in the front, Nightwing, wearing his cheesy ‘80s costume with the disco collar, is
								kissing STARFIRE. They’re still flanked by Wonder Girl and Kid Flash.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Before long I had other things on my mind.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Barbara is in a hospital bed, staring distantly in the reader’s direction. Dick is sitting on the far side of the
								bed in civilian clothes.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Babs and I talked a little after her injury, but there… wasn’t much to say.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Nightwing, now in his yellow ‘90s costume (though thankfully sans accompanying mullet), is seated alone on a bridge
								overlooking Titans Island.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] The second Titans team went their separate ways. The breakup was messy.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Two-shot of Barbara showing Dick a sketch of the Oracle logo and gesturing at the Clocktower in the background.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] I didn’t really have anywhere to go except back to Gotham. When I came back, Babs was…
									different. Not quite happier, but <em>motivated</em> .</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								Over-the-shoulder shot of Barbara turning to look at Nightwing, now in the modern blue-striped suit, leaning in the
								doorway with his arms folded and feet crossed.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] We didn’t actually start seeing each other until <em>after</em> I’d left for the ‘Haven. I
									didn’t think I was ready for another relationship, but when she <em>did</em> start to smile again… I just
									couldn’t resist.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE SEVENTEEN – SPLASH</strong></p>
								<p>Wide shot of Nightwing, standing on the roof of the Clocktower. We can tell he’s still in Gotham because the skyline
								is dominated by a skyscraper with the word “WAYNE” in large neon letters.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] I guess that brings you up to date.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Off-panel] We could’ve used you tonight.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE EIGHTEEN – THREE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Invert the layout of Page Nine so the “Y” is right-side-up.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Nightwing turns. BATMAN is standing behind him, partially illuminated by moonlight.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: Babs-</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [SFX] Ahem.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: <em>Oracle</em> said you had things under control.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: I <em>thought</em> I did.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Pull into a two-shot as Batman approaches and places a hand on Nightwing’s shoulder.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: But what I mean is that you’re always welcome here, Nightwing.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: I appreciate that.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								The same shot. Batman has lowered his hand.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Bruce has mellowed out a <em>lot</em> in the last few years, and any bad blood between us is
									ancient history.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] But <em>God</em> , it’s still so <em>awkward</em> sometimes.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE NINETEEN – FOUR PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>A wide shot and a row of two. Panel Four is inset in the corner of Panel Three.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Similar framing to the Page Seventeen splash, but Batman is standing next to Nightwing.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] I mean, it’s not like I can just say “Hey, dad, let’s go bowling!” or something.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Not unless we use deranged Arkham escapees as the pins.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Actually, that has possibilities.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: I imagine you’ll be heading back to Blüdhaven before long.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Batman is in the foreground, still looking out at the city. Nightwing is turning toward him in the background.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: Probably should’ve left a while ago.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: Actually, I was hoping to see you before I left.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Mirrored shot from the last one, with Batman now turning to look at Nightwing.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: Thank you, Di- Nightwing.</li>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] I feel like we should hug, but… he’s still not much of a hugger.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Closeup on Nightwing.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: <em>Actually,</em> I did need <em>one</em> thing…</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TWENTY – FOUR PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Grid.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Nightwing is riding the BATCYCLE down the freeway. A sign on the far side of the road says “GOTHAM – 11 MI.”</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								We see him still riding, now from behind. This angle shows another sign, this one saying “WELCOME TO BLÜDHAVEN.”
								Graffiti has been spray-painted over the word Blüdhaven, making it appear to be on fire.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Nightwing is climbing in through his apartment window, taking his mask off.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] I can still manage a few hours’ worth of zees before I’m due at the station.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Dick, now in pajamas, is sitting on the side of his bed and yawning, stretching his arms in the air.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] Even superheroes need their beauty sleep. Just don’t tell Bruce.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TWENTY-ONE – FOUR PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>Panel One is inset in Panel Two, which takes up most of the page. Panels Three and Four are a row at the bottom.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Dick, in uniform again, is standing in front of the steps of a large building. Above the door are the words “POLICE
								HEADQUARTERS.”</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] OK. Time to face the music. I <em>think</em> I’ve got a decent alibi.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Shot through the door of Dick entering the building and finding a scene of absolute mayhem. Officers are rushing
								hurriedly to-and-fro around the lobby. The receptionist is holding two phones, with a third jammed in the crook of
								his neck. The waiting area is crowded with visitors, several of them visibly injured. A crying baby appears to be
								entirely unattended.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>NIGHTWING: [Cap] What <em>now?</em></li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Two-shot of Dick trying to stop another uniformed officer.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: Hey, Drew, what’s going-</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								DREW pulls away and continues on his way, leaving Dick in the dust.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: -on?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TWENTY-TWO – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
								<p>A short, wide panel, a row of three, and a closing panel taking up about half the page.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Closeup of Amy, pushing through the crowd and yelling.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>AMY: <strong><em>GRAYSON!</em></strong> Where the holy <em>Hell</em> have you <em>been?!</em></li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Dick holds up his hands.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DICK: Sorry, Sarge, I just had a-</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Amy grabs Dick by the wrist and drags him along back towards the door.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>AMY: Actually, I don’t care. Come on, we’ve got an active firefight on Broadway and Fourth!</li>
								<li>DICK: What is <em>happening</em> here, Amy?!</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Closeup of Amy rubbing her temple and looking frustrated.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>AMY: You don’t even <em>know?</em></li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Closeup of Dick, jaw agape.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>AMY: [Off-panel] We’re in the middle of the biggest <em>gang war</em> in <em>decades.</em></li>
								<li>CAPTION: To be continued!</li>
