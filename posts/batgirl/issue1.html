								<em>PANEL ONE</em>

							<p>
								Wide exterior shot of a MOUNTAIN CLIFF. The terrain looks pretty rugged, with snow dotting parts of the ground and rocky soil surrounding it. Though the remains of an ANCIENT TEMPLE can be seen carved into the cliffs in the background, it looks like no one’s been here in a very long time. No one, that is, except for the dozen or so PEOPLE gathered by the edge of the cliff. Our shot is too distant to get good details, but they appear to be engaged in some form of BATTLE, with one lone figure in the center fending off attacks.

								<em>PANEL ONE</em>

							<p>
								Medium action shot of BEN TURNER (BRONZE TIGER), who’s wearing a climate-appropriate dark orange coat and a dark orange mask over the lower half of his face with the outlines of tiger fangs drawn on them, is in the thick of it, alongside a number of ASSASSINS. The assassins are nondescript, all dressed in cold weather outfits and full-face masks. They look distinctly ninja-y. Ben is doing pretty well, punching one of them across the face, but he’s clearly taken some damage, too.

							<h5>
								<em>PANEL TWO</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium action shot. Ben springs up into a side kick, totally horizontal, one of his hands resting on the shoulder of the assassin behind him as his foot connects solidly with another assassin’s face.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								DOT (VO)<br />
								Relevant information: Benjamin Turner is one of the most talented martial artists in the world.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL THREE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up on Ben’s face. His mouth is hidden by his mask, but his eyes are hard, focused, as he blocks a kick from one of the assassins.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								DOT (VO)<br />
								Turner is one of the three most well-known students of the renowned O-Sensei, alongside his goddaughter, Sandra “Shiva” Wu-san, and the reclusive Richard Dragon.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium action shot. Ben’s been seized about either wrist by the assassins, struggling against their grip as they hold his arms out to either side.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								DOT (VO)<br />
								However, most of Turner’s reputation was earned after he was kidnapped and brainwashed by the League of Assassins, becoming the killer known as Bronze Tiger.</p>
							<h5>

								Close-up as Ben, still being held in place, takes a PUNCH TO THE FACE from one of the other assassins.

							<p class="dialogue">
								DOT (VO)<br />
								After his rescue and deprogramming, Turner was recruited to serve on Amanda Waller’s Task Force X, for which he has frequently served as field commander over the years.</p>
								<div class="panel">
									<h5>
										<em>PANEL SIX</em>
									</h5>
									<p>
										Zoom out slightly. We can see that Ben is <em>dangerously</em>
										near the edge of the cliff… and that the assassins are dragging him closer yet. He struggles, but he doesn’t seem to be winning.

								Recently, however, Turner appears to have departed for a personal mission. Details of his goal are currently unknown.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of Ben’s BOOTS, digging into and pushing against the ground. The edge of the cliff is crumbling beneath his boots.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL EIGHT</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up on Ben’s eyes. He looks alarmed.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL NINE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Wide shot, and we can see that Ben is now falling off of the cliff. It’s pretty high up.

							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Shit. Shit. Shit!</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL TWO</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium shot. Ben, still falling, fumbles in his coat for something.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL THREE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up as Ben digs a pair of METAL CLAWS into the rock face of the cliff.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium shot from below. Ben hangs there for a moment, exhaling heavily (SFX: Whew!) We can see the edge of the cliff above him.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Same shot as Ben looks up, surprised and confused. COMBAT SOUNDS now come from the cliff above him.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								The hell?</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SIX</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Ben, still hanging there, startles as an ASSASSIN tied to a THICK METAL CORD falls over the cliff next to him, barely missing him. (SFX: WHMP)
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Ben stares at the dangling assassin next to him.

							<h5>
								<em>PANEL EIGHT</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Ben starts climbing the cord.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL NINE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up. A GLOVED HAND closes around Ben’s wrist as he reaches the top. He looks up, somewhere between surprised and wary.

								… Shiva? That you?</p>

							<p>
								Splash panel. From Ben’s POV, we see the kneeling figure of a woman in her late teens. Black gloves. Black boots. Black cape. Black bodysuit, with a yellow outline of a Bat stretched across it. But rather than a mask, we see the bare face of CASSANDRA CAIN, smiling down at Ben.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								No. I’m not.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL TWO</em>
							</h5>

								Close-up of Ben’s shocked reaction.

						<h4> <strong>PAGE FIVE</strong> </h4>
						<p> <em>Nine-panel grid.</em> </p>
						<div class="panel">
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL ONE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium wide shot. Cass and Ben are now both standing beside the cliff, amidst the group of unconscious assassins. Ben is brushing himself off, while Cass appears to be pulling the assassin from the previous page back up.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								You okay?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								All fine, except for my pride.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL TWO</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of Ben as he surveys the unconscious assassins.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Was a time when I could’ve handled all these guys without breaking a sweat. Guess it’s rough getting old.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL THREE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of Cass as she finishes hoisting the unconscious assassin back up, setting him down gently. Her expression is neutral, even vaguely pleasant.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								They <em>were</em> good. You… surprised?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (OFFSCREEN) <br /> 
								That they were good?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								No. They… surprise you?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (OFFSCREEN) <br /> 
								Oh. Yeah.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium shot. Ben stares at Cass, arms folded. Scrutinizing her.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								You’re her, aren’t you? Cain and Shiva’s kid.</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								Yes.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Full-body shot of Cass as she stands, brushing her hands against each other.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (OFFSCREEN) <br /> 
								God. You look so much like her. Your mother.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SIX</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of Ben as he stares at Cass, eyes narrowed.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								The way you talk, though… that’s <em>all</em> Cain.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
							</h5>

								Close-up as Cass tilts her head at Ben curiously.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								Knew… my father?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (OFFSCREEN) <br /> 
								In passing.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL EIGHT</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up as Ben scowls slightly.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Even when I was… the way I was… that guy creeped me out. Always talking about raising kids to ‘speak body language’ instead of real words. Train some ultimate fighter.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL NINE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium shot as Ben looks pointedly at the scattered, unconscious figures.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Guess it worked after all, huh?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS (OFFSCREEN) <br />

						<h4> <strong>PAGE SIX</strong> </h4>
						<p> <em>Nine-panel grid.</em> </p>

							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium two-shot. Both Cass and Ben look towards the entrance to the Temple behind them.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								This place was supposed to be empty. Don’t know how they heard it was here already. </p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								What's here?</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL TWO</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium two-shot. Ben looks at her, surprised, as Cass shakes her head.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								You don’t know?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								No.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Then why are you here?</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL THREE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of Cass. She’s returning Ben’s stare, and for the first time looks serious, maybe even worried.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								Need… help.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of Ben, who’s boring holes into her with his eyes.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								What kind of help?</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Back to the close-up of Cass.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								My mother... missing.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SIX</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium two-shot of Cass and Ben, staring at each other.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Disappearing is what she does.</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								This is… different. I think… in trouble. Think… <em>she</em>… needs help.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of Ben, still staring at Cass.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								I know your mother well. If she's in trouble, she can get herself out of it. And if you save her… she'll never forgive you for it.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL EIGHT</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of Cass. She’s glancing off to the side, away from Ben’s gaze.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								We fought. I won. Could have... killed her. But didn't.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL NINE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up as Cass returns her gaze to Ben, staring with an intensity to match his own.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								She already... won't forgive.</p>

						<p> <em>Nine-panel grid.</em> </p>
						<div class="panel">
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL ONE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Return of the medium two-shot. Ben has one hand under his chin, watching Cass in silence, evaluating.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL TWO</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Same shot as PANEL ONE, except now Ben is speaking.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								I’m sorry, how exactly did you get here, again?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								Climbed.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Right. Okay.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL THREE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium two-shot. Ben’s looking back at the Temple.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								All right. I’ll help you. But I’ve come this far -- I can’t just <em>leave</em>. So lemme make you an offer. You help me, and when we’re done, I help you. Deal?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								… deal.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium shot as Ben turns, walking towards the Temple and gesturing for Cass to follow him, which she does.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								What do you know about the Sensei?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								Your Sensei?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								No, that’s O-Sensei. I mean <em>the Sensei</em> . From the League of Assassins. </p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								Uh…
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up on Cass, who’s clearly racking her brain here.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								Assassin Sensei? Old. Ra’s’s father. Or… son? I forget.</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (OFFSCREEN) <br /> 
								Never really been sure, myself.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SIX</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium shot as Ben kneels down by the Temple door, sliding something into the lock.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Either way, he used to be the head trainer for the League of Assassins. I got treated to a taste of his medicine while I was there. But he and Ra’s had sort of a… falling out, around the same time Richard and Shiva rescued me. A guy gets the feeling it was related, but I was in a pretty bad place. My memories are spotty, y’feel?</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up as Cass stares into the distance, frowning.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS<br />
								Shiva… saved you?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Oh. Yeah.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL EIGHT</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up on Ben’s face as he works. He looks pensive.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								Your mother… she was always <em>intense</em>. But she wasn’t always like <em>this.</em> She used to have friends. She used to <em>smile</em>. Hell, she even used to crack bad puns, sometimes.</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								I don’t know. I guess the signs were always there. But it’s hard to believe she went from saving me from the League of Assassins…</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL NINE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium over-the-shoulder shot of Ben as he walks through the now-open door.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								… to training their next generation.</p>
						</div>
						<h4> <strong>PAGE EIGHT</strong> </h4>
						<p> <em>Seven panels. One wide panel, then two rows of three.</em> </p>
						<div class="panel">
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL ONE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Wide panel. Wide interior shot of an ANCIENT TEMPLE. The place is covered in layers upon layers of dust. Ancient statues adorn the hallway, most of them smashed or damaged, as though from a fight.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL TWO</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up as Cass looks around at the Temple, slightly awed.
							</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL THREE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up on one of the destroyed statues.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS (OFFSCREEN) <br /> 
								Was there… fight here?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (OFFSCREEN) <br /> 
								I’m getting to that.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up as Ben stares ahead determinedly. He looks resolute, and slightly uncomfortable.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN<br />
								This was the site of my last mission for the League. I was supposed to bring back a map for them.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up of an ANCIENT MAP, laying on a stone surface.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								See, the Lazarus Pits that Ra’s uses are limited. They recharge eventually, sure, but he still only has so many. And when any one of them gets contaminated, it’s a real danger to him. But Ra’s wasn’t the first one to unlock the Pits. And this map was supposed to have <em>hundreds</em> more suitable locations, all uncharted. Maybe even the source of the whole thing, according to some stories.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SIX</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium shot of Ben as BRONZE TIGER, walking through these same halls, which look just as dusty as in panel one, but substantially more intact. The SEPIA tint of the coloring tells us that this is a flashback.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								I’d been on the trail of it for weeks. Finally heard a rumor that it was here, and came to check it out myself. </p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								CASS (VO)<br />
								They… trusted you? Alone?</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />

								<em>Alone</em>? No.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Continuing the flashback. Pan back to see Ben’s accompanying LEAGUE HANDLER, a generic assassin.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								I had a partner for the whole thing.</p>
						</div>
						<h4> <strong>PAGE NINE</strong> </h4>
						<p> <em>Six-panel grid, entirely in flashback.</em> </p>
						<div class="panel">
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL ONE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium flashback shot as Bronze Tiger and his partner in what looks to be the temple’s inner sanctum. Bronze Tiger’s partner leans over the MAP, examining it, while Bronze Tiger keeps watch by the door.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								It’s funny, I can’t even remember her name now. Aida? Asha? Something like that.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL TWO</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Similar to the previous shot, except that Bronze Tiger is blocking a flying kick from RICHARD DRAGON.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								Well, anyway, that was where Richard and Shiva found me. Guess they’d been on my trail the whole time, and they’d finally caught up with me.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL THREE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium action shot. Bronze Tiger and Richard Dragon are now locked in intense combat, grappling with each other. Neither Shiva nor Bronze Tiger’s partner are anywhere in sight.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								I only half remember it, but I can tell you it was a hell of a fight.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium action shot. Bronze Tiger and Dragon have taken their fight back out into the rest of the temple, and are smashing the hell out of the place as collateral damage.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								I didn’t make it real easy on him…</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Close-up on Ben’s face as he snaps out of the brainwashing, Richard Dragon pinning him down.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								… but eventually, Richard got through to me. And we decided that if this place had kept that map from the League all these years… it could keep it from them a while longer. Guess we should’ve just burned it, but… I don’t know. It didn’t feel right, destroying something like that. And we thought that no one else would ever know.</p>
							<h5>
								<em>PANEL SIX</em>
							</h5>
							<p>
								Medium shot. Richard helps Ben back to his feet.
							</p>
							<p class="dialogue">
								BEN (VO)<br />
								But I guess they figured it out anyway. That’s why I’m here. To get it before they can.</p>
							<p class="dialogue">

								Wide shot of a SENTRY STATUE standing in the doorway. It’s very big, a bit busted up, but still pretty intact looking. Think a stone warrior statue, but ancient enough for some of its features to have worn down over time, and very, very big.
