								<em>PANACEA PART ONE: THE MIRACLE CURE</em>
							</h3>
							<hr />
							<p><strong>PAGE ONE – ONE PANEL</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								It’s night. We see the Gotham skyline from above. The Bat-Signal is painted across a cloud drifting past the reader.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>TITLE: PANACEA PART I – THE MIRACLE CURE</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TWO – NINE PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Three men in dark clothes and ski masks are gathered around a rooftop door. One is kneeling, trying to pry the door
								open with a crowbar. We can still see the Signal in the background.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: [Off-panel] I assume you lost your <em>keys</em>, gentlemen?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								The three burglars look over their shoulders in shock. A dark shadow is cast over them. The edge of BATMAN’s cape is
								blowing into the foreground.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BURGLAR 1: B-B-B-</li>
								<li>BURGLAR 2: Don’t stutter at him…</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Closeup of BURGLAR 2.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BURGLAR 2: [Yelling] <em>Get him!</em></li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Low angle of Batman, in silhouette, backhanding Burglar 2 as the other two burglars approach him.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Closeup on Batman’s hand, grabbing BURGLAR 3’s crowbar and jabbing it into his stomach.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								BURGLAR 1 is now holding a pistol, pointing it at Batman.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Seven</strong><br />
								Closeup of Batman’s face, twisted into a snarl.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Eight</strong><br />
								Burglar 1 drops the gun and raises his hands in surrender.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Nine</strong><br />
								The three burglars are tied up together, lying next to the still-lit Bat-Signal.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORDON: [Off-panel] I’m getting too old for this.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE THREE – SEVEN PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								COMMISSIONER JAMES GORDON is standing in the foreground, lit by the signal off to the side. Batman is on the edge of
								the roof in the background, still in silhouette.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: We all are, Jim.</li>
								<li>GORDON: Hmph. And here I was starting to <em>buy</em> the rumors that you’re immortal.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Caption] James Gordon. Police Commissioner. My friend.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Closeup of Batman stepping into the light. The expression on his face doesn’t quite rise to the level of a smile,
								but is at least more pleasantly neutral than usual.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: No such luck. Why the Signal? Did you locate any of the Arkham escapees*?</li>
								<li>CAPTION: *A mass breakout happened in the smash DCW: Alpha oneshot! Where were you? - SelfEditingJamags</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Closeup of Jim lighting his pipe.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORDON: Don’t count yourself out just yet. Call came in from the CEO of <em>Gothcorp</em> , of all people.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Low angle of Batman and Jim.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: The new one. Gorman?</li>
								<li>GORDON: The same. He tells me Gothcorp is rolling out some kind of miracle drug. He was cagey with the details,
									but to hear him talk you’d think it turns lead into gold and donkeys into unicorns.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: Smells like a con.</li>
								<li>GORDON: Probably <em>is</em> . But Gorman seems to think that after the public announcement, someone will try to
									steal it. That’s where <em>you</em> come in.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Closeup of Batman, one eyebrow raised.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: So I’m playing watchdog for a phony drug? <em>Now,</em> of all times?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								Jim turns to gesture at a skyscraper in the distance with “Gothcorp” written across the side in large neon letters.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORDON: Thought you should at least hear about it. I’m more worried about what happens if one of our escapees
									hits their headquarters. Besides, if it <em>is</em> all a fraud, you can—</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Seven</strong><br />
								Jim turns back towards Batman and he’s gone.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORDON: —Every damn time.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE FOUR – THREE PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Low angle on the Batmobile driving down a Gotham street, splashing water up towards the reader. Dawn is beginning to
								peek through the clouds in the background.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] I’ve been watching Gorman ever since I helped land his predecessor in prison.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] He’s invited Bruce Wayne—and about half the reporters and socialites in Gotham—to a reception at
									Gothcorp International Headquarters in the Diamond District of Old Gotham. He’s set to make a major
									announcement.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] Unless I miss my guess, Jim’s just spoiled the big surprise for me.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Show the Batmobile pulling into the cave’s entrance from inside, a red-and-white striped roadblock rising back into
								place in the background outside.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Batman is exiting the Batmobile. ALFRED is dusting the Bat-Computer in the background.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>ALFRED: I trust tonight’s adventures were suitably violent, Master Bruce?</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] Alfred Pennyworth. Family Butler. He raised me after my parents’ death.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE FIVE – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Closeup on Batman removing his mask to reveal BRUCE WAYNE.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BRUCE: Just a few second-story men. No trouble.</li>
								<li>ALFRED: [Off-panel] My condolences, sir.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Alfred folds his arms and gives his best disapproving stare.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>ALFRED: And might I ask what urgent matter brings you to your ancestral home at five in the morning?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Bruce is hanging up his cape and belt.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BRUCE: Actually, I thought I might catch up on some sleep so I can attend a social function.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Closeup on Alfred, one eyebrow raised skeptically.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								The same angle.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>ALFRED: Are you <em>certain</em> you’re <em>entirely</em> all right, sir?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE SIX – ONE PANEL</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Establishing shot of a municipal-looking building, with copious columns and relief sculptures. It’s daytime. A small
								figure is ascending its front steps.</p>
							<p><strong>PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Shot over the shoulder of DEREK ALTMAN, a balding, overweight man in a suit, looking down the steps at CHELSEA
								MCKAY, a twenty-something woman, about four feet tall, in an overcoat with round, monolithically large glasses. A
								resemblance to Velma Dinkley would not be entirely coincidental.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>CHELSEA: Sorry to keep you waiting. Uh, <em>am</em> I late?</li>
								<li>DEREK: Just on time. And it’s not <em>exactly</em> an appellate proceeding.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Chelsea and Derek are filing through the door into a large, marble-tiled lobby.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>CHELSEA: I just wanted to thank you again. For taking me on, that is.</li>
								<li>DEREK: Thank <em>us?</em> With your credentials?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Closeup of Chelsea.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>CHELSEA: Well, I mean, it’s not- It’s just-</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Closeup of Derek.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DEREK: Don’t be so modest, kid. Tell me, why’d you give up clerking?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								The two pass through another door, which swings out towards the reader so that the writing on the frosted glass is
								legible. It says “DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE.”</p>
							<ol>
								<li>CHELSEA: I think you know why.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE EIGHT – EIGHT PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Shot of the doorway from inside the office. The office well lit, but cluttered with cardboard boxes full of
								paperwork. Several desks are scattered around the room. Derek has turned to face Chelsea.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DEREK: Your old man was a helluva lawyer. I always said they don’t make ‘em like Chuck McKay anymore, but I
									figure you’ve got plenty of time to prove an old fart like me wrong.</li>
								<li>VIC: [Off-panel] She just got here, Altman. Let her get a conviction or two before we crown the next Harvey
									Dent.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								VIC CLARENCE, a scruffy-looking man in his mid-thirties, shakes Chelsea’s hand from his desk while Derek folds his
								arms in the background.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>CHELSEA: Chelsea McKay, I’m the new ADA.</li>
								<li>VIC: Vic Clarence. I’m an <em>old</em> ADA.</li>
								<li>DEREK: You know better than to joke about Harvey, Vic.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Vic waves his hand at Derek.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>VIC: C’mon, Derek. Arkham screwballs are a fact of life for us.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Closeup of Derek, grimacing.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DEREK: Harvey’s <em>different</em> .</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								JANET CROFT, a middle-aged woman in a crisp suit, leans out from behind another desk.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>JANET: <em>Easy,</em> boys. New kid in town doesn’t need to see you two tearing each other’s throats out. Want
									me to get her set up with a caseload?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								Derek straightens out his suit as Chelsea walks over to Janet.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>DEREK: Yes, of course. Thank you, Janet.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Seven</strong><br />
								Janet lays out a stack of papers on the desk in front of Chelsea.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>JANET: Welcome to the family, McKay. One good thing about working in Gotham is you never get bored.</li>
								<li>CHELSEA: I don’t suppose any of this relates to… the Penguin?</li>
								<li>JANET: Trust me, kid.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Eight</strong><br />
								Closeup of Janet.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>That’s one case you’d better hope you <em>never</em> get.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE NINE – EIGHT PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								High angle of a police car pulling up to the curb next to an old, worn-down brownstone. It’s darker than the last
								scene, but still day. Two more police cars are already parked.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								HARVEY BULLOCK exits the cruiser holding a half-eaten doughnut. OFFICER 1, a uniformed officer, is stepping up to
								greet him.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BULLOCK: OK, where’s the stiff?</li>
								<li>OFFICER 1: Uh, it’s upstai-</li>
								<li>BULLOCK: Just show me. And while we’re on the way, tell me why Major Crimes got this instead of Homicide, huh?
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Angle from behind Bullock and Officer 1 as they’re walking down a hallway. There are doors, some of which have
								numbers and most of which have places where numbers used to be before they were worn off over time. The carpet has
								probably not been vacuumed in twenty years. OFFICER 2 is ducking into a door ahead.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BULLOCK: That the place?</li>
								<li>OFFICER 1: That’s the bathroom, Detective Bullock.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Angle from ahead of Bullock and Officer 1 as they pass the bathroom door. Bullock’s doughnut is still in his hand,
								albeit a few bites smaller.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>OFFICER 2: [From inside the bathroom] <em>Urrrrf!</em></li>
								<li>BULLOCK: Rookies.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								Officer 1 points into an open door.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>OFFICER 1: In here, sir.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								Closeup of Bullock in the doorway.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Seven</strong><br />
								The same angle. Bullock is holding up his doughnut and looking at it suspiciously.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Eight</strong><br />
								Bullock turns back to Officer 1.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BULLOCK: I wasn’t gonna eat this anyway. You want it?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TEN – THREE PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Bullock and Officer 1 are leaning on either side of the bathroom door. Inside, Officer 2 is washing his face.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BULLOCK: So, this mess has been here, what? A day? Two days?</li>
								<li>OFFICER 1: Or longer.</li>
								<li>BULLOCK: Let me guess. The landlord only found it because the neighbors complained about the smell.</li>
								<li>OFFICER 1: Apparently, one of them threatened to call a lawyer.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Officer 2 steps up to the doorway.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BULLOCK: So our perp’s long gone, and I ain’t <em>certain</em> , but that didn’t look like enough chunks to make
									a whole human, so that ain’t even all of our <em>victim</em> .</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Officer 2 is now kneeling back by the toilet.</p>
							<p><strong>PAGE ELEVEN – THREE PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Bruce is riding in the back of an expensive-looking black sedan. It’s night again outside. We see the edge of
								Alfred’s shoulder in the driver’s seat.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BRUCE: Is everyone in position?</li>
								<li>ROBIN: [Via communicator] I’m set up with visual, but the most suspicious thing I’ve spotted is whatever they’ve
									got on the hors d’oeuvres tray.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] Robin. An apprentice of sorts. The third to hold the title.</li>
								<li>ORACLE: [Comm] I’m inside their system. Their security is cutting edge… for about fifteen years ago.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] Oracle. Formerly known as Batgirl. Now the superhero world’s foremost researcher and tech expert.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Closeup of Bruce through the side window.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BRUCE: Any data on our miracle drug?</li>
								<li>ORACLE: [Comm] Weirdly, no. Almost nothing. I’ve got some references to a “Project: Panacea” in budget documents
									but no testing records, no advertising material, and certainly no formula.</li>
								<li>BRUCE: Keep me posted. All right, I should be fashionably late enough by now. You can stop circling, Alfred.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Wide shot of Bruce exiting the car onto a crowded sidewalk full of well-dressed people.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>VICKI: [Off-panel] Bruce!</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TWELVE – FOUR PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Bruce turns, facing VICKI VALE, who is running up to him waving a notepad.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>VICKI: I wasn’t expecting to see <em>you</em> here. Any insight on the mystery announcement?</li>
								<li>BRUCE: <em>I</em> wasn’t expecting to see me here either. I’m just a curious citizen tonight.</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] Vicki Vale. Reporter for the Gotham Gazette. We were close once. I made some sacrifices and more
									mistakes, but she eventually forgave me.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Shot from in front of the two as they shuffle through the front door into a huge, ostentatious glass atrium.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>VICKI: You sure you’re not holding out on me?</li>
								<li>BRUCE: Promise. I’ll probably learn more from whatever <em>you</em> write than I will from the announcement.
								</li>
								<li>VICKI: Oh, I’ve heard <em>that</em> one before, Mr. Wayne.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Shot over Bruce’s shoulder as Vicki flits off into the crowd.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GUS: [Off-panel] Ladies and gentlemen!</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Low angle of GUS GORMAN, a man in his thirties who fills out a suit very nicely, standing at a lectern at the rear
								of the atrium. A well-dressed elderly couple are exiting an elevator, a janitor is entering another, a woman in a
								black dress is going into the stairwell, and a flustered-looking waitress is trying to slide across the edge of the
								stage to get back into the crowd.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORMAN: I’m so glad you all could make it, and I hope you like… <em>whatever</em> it is the hors d’oeuvres are.
								</li>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] Gus Gorman. Wall Street turnaround specialist. Brought on as CEO to salvage Gothcorp’s stock price
									after Ferris Boyle went to prison for insider trading.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								Same angle, but pull in a little closer on Gorman.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORMAN: It won’t do any of us any good to sugarcoat things. Gothcorp has made a lot of mistakes in the past. But
									I was hired to change all that. I was hired because I believe in change, progress, and new beginnings.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Move in for a closeup. Gorman is reaching into his jacket.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORMAN: Our incredible research team has been moving heaven and earth to <em>create</em> our new beginning. And
									the fruit of that effort…</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Extreme closeup of Gorman’s hand holding a glass vial full of an almost-clear liquid with a very slight green tint.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORMAN: … Is <em>this</em> .</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Back out to the closeup. Gorman is holding the vial in front of his right eye.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORMAN: We call it “Panacea,” like the ancient Greek goddess of health— <em>universal</em> health, apparently.
									And you aren’t gonna believe this, but I’ll be darned if that isn’t what it does. Our testing so far indicates
									that Panacea can, with sufficient time and dosage, heal <em>any</em> injury.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								The crowd erupts into raised hands and shouted questions. Bruce, in the foreground, is glancing suspiciously to the
								side.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>CROWD 1: How does it work?</li>
								<li>CROWD 2: Isn’t this too good to be true?</li>
								<li>CROWD 3: You don’t expect us to <em>believe</em> this?</li>
								<li>BRUCE: Something’s wrong about this.</li>
								<li>ORACLE: [Comm] <em>Everything’s</em> wrong about this.</li>
								<li>ROBIN: [Comm] But what if it really <em>does</em> do what he says?</li>
								<li>ORACLE: [Comm] It <em>doesn’t.</em></li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE FOURTEEN – SIX PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								A heavyset man in the crowd trips and falls.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>FALLING MAN: [SFX: Ghugh]</li>
								<li>CROWD 4: Oh my God!</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Bruce turns to look at the fallen man as a few more people begin to drop.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BRUCE: Robin. Notice anything off about the waiters?</li>
								<li>ROBIN: [Comm] No, wh- Wait. There <em>are</em> none.</li>
								<li>BRUCE: Not <em>now</em> . So where…?</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Low angle of a woman with long, dark hair in a waitstaff uniform approaching Gorman. She’s withdrawing a dagger from
								her sleeve.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>ROBIN: [Comm] There! Along the sides!</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Four</strong><br />
								Bruce tumbles over into a small round table covered with a tablecloth.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] This won’t be my cleanest change, but it’ll have to do.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Five</strong><br />
								We see the tablecloth lying overtop of Bruce.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Six</strong><br />
								Batman rises from the floor towards the reader, throwing the cloth off.</p>
							<p><strong>PAGE FIFTEEN – FIVE PANELS</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
								The waitress assassin lunges at Gorman, knife in hand.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GORMAN: Someone, help!</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />

							<ol>
								<li>BATMAN: [Cap] Don’t know what weapons she has poisoned. Can’t risk much contact.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Two</strong><br />
								Close in and turn the angle a little to the right so we see more of the boardroom. Batman lunges forward and grabs
								Cheshire by the arm.</p>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />

							<ol>
								<li>ORACLE: [Comm] The security cameras aren’t showing you in the halls.</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>Panel Three</strong><br />
								Batman and Gorman have reached a door with a plaque next to it saying “GUS GORMAN – CEO.” Batman is turning the
								doorknob.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>ORACLE: [Comm] That means someone’s looping the footage, which means—</li>
							</ol>
							<p><strong>PAGE TWENTY-TWO – ONE PANEL</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Panel One</strong><br />
