							<p>
								<em>Two panels, half and half.</em>
							</p>
							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Full width. We open on an exterior wide shot of a dingy looking WAREHOUSE, sometime
									around late afternoon. Its walls could use a good power wash, its windows are
									clouded
									with dust and grime, and its suspiciously empty parking lot is surrounded by a rusty
									chain link fence.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Full width. Interior wide shot of a CHOP SHOP GARAGE. A variety of half-stripped
									cars
									are scattered around. A slightly run-down ‘56 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL sits in the middle
									with its hood up. A man bends over the hood, his face hidden from the viewer at this
									angle.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">

							<p>
								Five panels.
							</p>
							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Full width, medium shot. Face now visible, WILLIS TODD looks over his shoulder, down
									at
									a young (~10) JASON TODD, who stands to the side with his arms folded sullenly
									across
									his
									chest.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									WILLIS<br />
									I said are you listenin’ to me, Jason?
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON<br />
									Sure. Whatever.

								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up shot. Willis scratches the back of his neck. He looks a little nervous.

								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									WILLIS<br />
									Well… I was thinkin&#39; you an’ me could work on it together, right? Maybe get
									to know each other a bit, since, y’know, I been --

									<em>PANEL THREE</em>

								<p>
									Medium shot. Jason is glaring at Willis, arms still folded, apparently unimpressed.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON<br />
									Doin’ time?
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot. Willis sticks both hands in his pockets.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									WILLIS<br />
									Since I been away, alright?
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot. Jason turns his head, scoffing.

								<p class="dialogue">
									WILLIS (OFFSCREEN)<br />
									Hey, c’mon, that ain’t fair.

								Six-panel grid.

							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot. Willis crosses his arms in a mirror of his son.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									WILLIS<br />
									Look, it ain’t like I <em>wanted</em> to get busted. I <em>wanted</em> to be here
									for
									you an’ your mom. But that just ain’t how it worked out.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot as Jason looks at Willis accusingly.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON<br />
									Mom’s sick. She’s <em>been</em> sick.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL THREE</em>

									Medium shot as Willis looks down at Jason, arms still folded.

								<p class="dialogue">
									WILLIS<br />
									An’ now I’m here t’take care of her, alright? Take care of you <em>both</em>.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up as Willis stares off to the side and into the distance, expression now

								</p>
								<p>
									optimistic.
								</p>
								<p>
									WILLIS
									This new gig I got… I&#39;m gonna be makin’ money. <em>Real</em> money.
									Things’re gonna
									be different from here on out. I promise. Okay?
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot. The hands on Jason&#39;s crossed arms are balled into fists, but
									his
									shoulders are slumped. His head is pointed away from Willis, but he looks at
									him out of
									the corner of his eye.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON<br />
									… okay.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL SIX</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Zoom out to a wide shot. Willis turns back to the car. Jason looks on
									cautiously, arms

								<p>
									unfolded.

								<p class="dialogue">
									WILLIS<br />
									Now. Let’s start with how t’change a tire...

							<p>
								Two panels, half and half.

							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Full width. Exterior wide shot of MCSURLEY&#39;S BAR, the run-down bar of Barr fame.

									sign on the outside reads <del>GOOD</del> BAD FOOD <del>COLD</del> WARM BEER.

								<p class="dialogue">
									NARRATION<br />
									Now.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Full width. Interior wide shot of McSurley’s bar. It’s night, and the bar is
									packed with
									various seedy elements. At the bar on the edge of the crowd sits an adult JASON
									TODD, in
									jeans and a leather jacket, with a beer in front of him.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h4>
								<strong>PAGE FIVE</strong>
							</h4>
							<p>
								Eight panels, one row of two and two of three.
							</p>
							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up as Jason takes a drink from his beer, eyes glancing to the side.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									So I might have pissed off Black Mask again.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Cutaway to a medium shot of Black Mask at his desk, shouting angrily into a phone.

								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									See, Sionis has been making a move on the arms trade in Gotham.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>PANELS THREE THROUGH FIVE</em>
									Three panels of scenes from Gotham arms smuggling, all wide shots: a truck
									driving on a
									back road in the dead of night, a shipping freighter coming into the docks, and
									a group
									of men standing around doing a gun sale.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>PANELS SIX THROUGH EIGHT</em>
									Three panels of follow-up to the ones above: the truck drivers glancing around
									in alarm
									as the back of the truck explodes, an explosion coming from the shipping
									freighter, and
									the boxes of product in the gun sale, you guessed it, exploding.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									So I’ve made a few moves of my own.
								</p>

							</h4>
							<p>
								Nine-panel grid.
							</p>
							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up. Jason looks moderately amused as he continues to drink.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									And now I’m back on Black Mask’s shit list.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									(Not that I ever left.)
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot as Black Mask shouts <em>very</em> angrily into a phone.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									And Mask’s looking to get himself back in supply.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL THREE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Wide shot. Three men at a table in the corner whisper among themselves.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Enter: Marty Green and the TNT brothers.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									(Not a band.)
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									(Actually, I&#39;d listen to that.)
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Zoom in on TREVOR AND TERRY BREWER, leaning across the table as
									they whisper.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Trevor and Terry Brewer. Big-time arms dealers from Hub City who
									had to skip town when
									things got a little too hot. They’re new in town, and looking to
									make friends.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up on Marty across the table, gesturing with both hands as
									he whispers back.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									And Black Mask wants to be that friend. So he sent in
									<em>his</em> buddy Marty to help
									grease the wheels.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL SIX</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot. Back to Jason watching that corner.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									So here I am, having a drink while they have their little chat.
									Just gotta wait until
									someone drops a location, and I can get out of here.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up. Jason takes a drink.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Wonder what I’m going to do with these ones. Stealing them’s not
									worth it. Blowing them
									up’s getting old.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL EIGHT</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up of Jason, who seems enthralled in -- and amused by-- his
									own train of thought.
								</p>
								<p>

								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Maybe I’ll just swap all the ammo with blanks. Expensive,
									but the <em>look</em> on his
									face -- well, if he had one --
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL NINE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Wide shot. A new MAN enters the bar. He’s dressed fancier
									than anyone around here, with a
								</p>
								<p>
									suit and an expensive watch, looking notably out of place.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Hang on. Who’s this, now?
								</p>
							</div>
							<h4>
								<strong>PAGE SEVEN</strong>
							</h4>
							<p>
								Seven panels, see breakdown.
							</p>
							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅔ width, medium shot. The man from the previous page looks around, adjusting a
									cufflink.

								</p>
								<p>
									Sneering a little bit.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Clothes say he’s got money. Watch agrees. Not a millionaire, but well off. Lawyer,
									maybe
									an accountant. What&#39;s he doing here?
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width. Medium shot of a woman at the bar who&#39;s clearly a sex worker. She eyes
									the
								</p>
								<p>
									new arrival appraisingly.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Nevermind, figured it out.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL THREE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, close-up. Jason goes back to his drink.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Not my business, then.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅔ width, medium shot. The businessman sits down next to the woman, and
									his hand is
									already on her leg. She looks a bit taken aback, willing to roll with it
									but clearly
									getting bad vibes from this guy.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Or it wouldn’t be, if he weren’t being a fucking asshole about it.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, close-up. Jason is visibly scowling.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									I hate these fucking people. Rolling in here like we&#39;re all just
									set dressing. Their
									own personal amusement park.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL SIX</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, close-up. Jason&#39;s expression darkens further.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									You want a good time? Fine. But show some goddamn respect.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, close-up. Jason takes a large gulp of his drink.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									But she can handle herself. I need to focus.
								</p>
							</div>

								Eleven panels, see breakdown.

									together.

								</p>
								<p>

								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL THREE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, medium shot. The businessman is leaning way into the woman&#39;s personal
									space.
								</p>
								<p>
									She looks uncomfortable.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, medium shot. Jason stares across the bar.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									1/6 width. Glenn and the TNT brothers chat.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL SIX</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									½ width. The businessman is pulling at the woman&#39;s bra strap. She has a hand
									up,
								</p>
								<p>
									indicating him to back off.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL SEVEN</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, close-up. Jason stares across the bar.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL EIGHT</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									1/9 width. Glenn and the TNT brothers.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL NINE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									5/9 width. The businessman has his hand on the woman&#39;s stomach. She&#39;s
									grabbing
									his wrist, apparently saying something to him indignantly, but there&#39;s
									no dialogue.

								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TEN</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, extreme close-up of Jason&#39;s eyes. Jason stares across the bar.

								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ELEVEN</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅔ width. The businessman is grabbing the woman&#39;s arm, apparently saying
									something
								</p>
								<p>
									back angrily. She looks furious and alarmed, trying to jerk her arm away.
								</p>
							</div>
							<h4>
								<strong>PAGE NINE</strong>
							</h4>
							<p>
								Three panels, see breakdown.
							</p>
							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width. Close-up on Jason&#39;s hand as he slaps a handful of cash on the bar.
									Enough
									to

								</p>
								<p>
									cover his drink, and any damages.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅔ width. Over the shoulder shot, medium. The creep, still holding the woman’s arm,
									looks
								</p>
								<p>
									over his shoulder in surprise as Jason, only his arm visible, taps on it.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON<br />

									Full width panel, medium action shot. Jason decks him.

							<h4>
								<strong>PAGE TEN</strong>
							</h4>

							</p>Nine panels. As this page progresses, the panel get smaller, and except for the last
							panel,
							blurrier and harder to follow.
							</p>
							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									½ width, medium shot. The guy lunges back at Jason, catching him around the waist.

								<p>
									½ width, medium shot. Jason and the guy, predictably, topple onto a nearby table.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL THREE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, medium shot. Chaos begins to ensue. One of the other patrons takes a swing
									at

								</p>
								<p>
									Jason, which connects.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, medium shot. The bartender, McSurley himself, ducks into the back room
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FIVE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									⅓ width, medium shot. It is at this point that the lines and colors begin to blur as
									this
									action sequence devolves. Multiple people are now slugging it out, with Jason in the
									center.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL SIX</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									¼ width, wide shot. People are now clearing out of the bar and away from the brawl.

								<h5>
									<em>PANEL NINE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									¼ width, medium shot. Jason stands alone above the now unconscious creep, fists
									at his

									You okay?

									the scene.

								<strong>PAGE TWENTY-TWO</strong>

							<p>
								Four panels.

							<div class="panel">
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL ONE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot. Jason sags against the wall behind him, looking genuinely upset.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									Damn it. God damn it. <strong>Why?</strong>

								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL TWO</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up. Jason puts a hand over his eyes.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									The other guys were fair. Pain in my ass, but I <strong>got</strong> it,
									y&#39;know? But
									<strong>Charlie</strong>? Fuck, what the hell did he ever do? He was just a chop
									shopper. Never killed anyone, never laid a hand on anyone, never ■■■■ed with any
									kids.
									He didn&#39;t deserve this shit.
								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL THREE</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Medium shot. Jason sits with his hands folded in front of him, staring at the
									ground.
								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									I know who it is now. It&#39;s the numbers. He&#39;s changed the pattern, but I
									still
									see it. Three sets of three. A pair and an odd one out. The familiar hiding in
									the
									unfamiliar. Because I know exactly who Charlie and Jordan used to work for,
									before I
									hired ‘em on. The same son of a bitch my father used to work for, before he
									killed him.

								</p>
								<h5>
									<em>PANEL FOUR</em>
								</h5>
								<p>
									Close-up of Jason&#39;s face as he looks up. He looks <em>pissed.</em>

								</p>
								<p class="dialogue">
									JASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)<br />
									<strong>Two-Face.</strong>
