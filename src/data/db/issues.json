We open on an exterior wide shot of a dingy looking WAREHOUSE, sometime around late afternoon. Its walls could use a good power wash, its windows are clouded with dust and grime, and its suspiciously empty parking lot is surrounded by a rusty chain link fence.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nFull width. Interior wide shot of a CHOP SHOP GARAGE. A variety of half-stripped cars are scattered around. A slightly run-down ‘56 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL sits in the middle with its hood up. A man bends over the hood, his face hidden from the viewer at this angle.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION BLURB\nThen.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nMAN\n-- just wasting away in some old lot. Don’t think anyone’s even driven it in years. So I was thinkin' -- hey, are you listenin’ to me?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWO**\nFive panels.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFull width, medium shot. Face now visible, WILLIS TODD looks over his shoulder, down at a young (~10) JASON TODD, who stands to the side with his arms folded sullenly across his chest.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWILLIS\nI said are you listenin’ to me, Jason?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSure. Whatever.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up shot. Willis scratches the back of his neck. He looks a little nervous.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWILLIS\nWell… I was thinkin' you an’ me could work on it together, right? Maybe get to know each other a bit, since, y’know, I been --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason is glaring at Willis, arms still folded, apparently unimpressed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nDoin’ time?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Willis sticks both hands in his pockets.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWILLIS\nSince I been away, alright?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason turns his head, scoffing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWILLIS (OFFSCREEN)\nHey, c’mon, that ain’t fair.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THREE**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Willis crosses his arms in a mirror of his son.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWILLIS\nLook, it ain’t like I *wanted* to get busted. I *wanted* to be here for you an’ your mom. But that just ain’t how it worked out.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot as Jason looks at Willis accusingly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nMom’s sick. She’s *been* sick.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot as Willis looks down at Jason, arms still folded.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWILLIS\nAn’ now I’m here t’take care of her, alright? Take care of you *both*.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up as Willis stares off to the side and into the distance, expression now optimistic.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWILLIS\nThis new gig I got… I'm gonna be makin’ money. *Real* money. Things’re gonna be different from here on out. I promise. Okay?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. The hands on Jason's crossed arms are balled into fists, but his shoulders are slumped. His head is pointed away from Willis, but he looks at him out of the corner of his eye.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n… okay.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nZoom out to a wide shot. Willis turns back to the car. Jason looks on cautiously, arms unfolded.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWILLIS\nNow. Let’s start with how t’change a tire...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOUR**\nTwo panels, half and half.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFull width. Exterior wide shot of MCSURLEY'S BAR, the run-down bar of Barr fame. A sign on the outside reads ~~GOOD~~ BAD FOOD ~~COLD~~ WARM BEER.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION\nNow.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nFull width. Interior wide shot of McSurley’s bar. It’s night, and the bar is packed with various seedy elements. At the bar on the edge of the crowd sits an adult JASON TODD, in jeans and a leather jacket, with a beer in front of him.\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIVE**\nEight panels, one row of two and two of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up as Jason takes a drink from his beer, eyes glancing to the side.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo I might have pissed off Black Mask again.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nCutaway to a medium shot of Black Mask at his desk, shouting angrily into a phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSee, Sionis has been making a move on the arms trade in Gotham.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANELS THREE THROUGH FIVE*\nThree panels of scenes from Gotham arms smuggling, all wide shots: a truck driving on a back road in the dead of night, a shipping freighter coming into the docks, and a group of men standing around doing a gun sale.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANELS SIX THROUGH EIGHT*\nThree panels of follow-up to the ones above: the truck drivers glancing around in alarm as the back of the truck explodes, an explosion coming from the shipping freighter, and the boxes of product in the gun sale, you guessed it, exploding.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo I’ve made a few moves of my own.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIX**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up. Jason looks moderately amused as he continues to drink.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAnd now I’m back on Black Mask’s shit list.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Not that I ever left.)\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot as Black Mask shouts *very* angrily into a phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAnd Mask’s looking to get himself back in supply.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nWide shot. Three men at a table in the corner whisper among themselves.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nEnter: Marty Green and the TNT brothers.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Not a band.)\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Actually, I'd listen to that.)\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nZoom in on TREVOR AND TERRY BREWER, leaning across the table as they whisper.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nTrevor and Terry Brewer. Big-time arms dealers from Hub City who had to skip town when things got a little too hot. They’re new in town, and looking to make friends.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Marty across the table, gesturing with both hands as he whispers back.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAnd Black Mask wants to be that friend. So he sent in *his* buddy Marty to help grease the wheels.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. Back to Jason watching that corner.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo here I am, having a drink while they have their little chat. Just gotta wait until someone drops a location, and I can get out of here.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up. Jason takes a drink.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWonder what I’m going to do with these ones. Stealing them’s not worth it. Blowing them up’s getting old.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up of Jason, who seems enthralled in -- and amused by-- his own train of thought.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMaybe I’ll just swap all the ammo with blanks. Expensive, but the *look* on his face -- well, if he had one --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nWide shot. A new MAN enters the bar. He’s dressed fancier than anyone around here, with a suit and an expensive watch, looking notably out of place.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHang on. Who’s this, now?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVEN**\nSeven panels, see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n⅔ width, medium shot. The man from the previous page looks around, adjusting a cufflink. Sneering a little bit.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nClothes say he’s got money. Watch agrees. Not a millionaire, but well off. Lawyer, maybe an accountant. What's he doing here?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n⅓ width. Medium shot of a woman at the bar who's clearly a sex worker. She eyes the new arrival appraisingly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNevermind, figured it out.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason goes back to his drink.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot my business, then.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\n⅔ width, medium shot. The businessman sits down next to the woman, and his hand is already on her leg. She looks a bit taken aback, willing to roll with it but clearly getting bad vibes from this guy.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOr it wouldn’t be, if he weren’t being a fucking asshole about it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason is visibly scowling.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI hate these fucking people. Rolling in here like we're all just set dressing. Their own personal amusement park.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason's expression darkens further.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nYou want a good time? Fine. But show some goddamn respect.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason takes a large gulp of his drink.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut she can handle herself. I need to focus.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHT**\nEleven panels, see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Jason stares across the bar.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Marty and the TNT brothers talk amongst themselves, heads together.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\n⅓ width, medium shot. The businessman is leaning way into the woman's personal space. She looks uncomfortable.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Jason stares across the bar.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\n1/6 width. Glenn and the TNT brothers chat.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\n½ width. The businessman is pulling at the woman's bra strap. She has a hand up, indicating him to back off.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason stares across the bar.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\n1/9 width. Glenn and the TNT brothers.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\n5/9 width. The businessman has his hand on the woman's stomach. She's grabbing his wrist, apparently saying something to him indignantly, but there's no dialogue.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\n⅓ width, extreme close-up of Jason's eyes. Jason stares across the bar.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ELEVEN*\n⅔ width. The businessman is grabbing the woman's arm, apparently saying something back angrily. She looks furious and alarmed, trying to jerk her arm away.\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINE**\nThree panels, see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n⅓ width. Close-up on Jason's hand as he slaps a handful of cash on the bar. Enough to cover his drink, and any damages.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n⅔ width. Over the shoulder shot, medium. The creep, still holding the woman’s arm, looks over his shoulder in surprise as Jason, only his arm visible, taps on it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n‘Scuze me.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCREEP\nHuh?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nFull width panel, medium action shot. Jason decks him.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TEN**\nNine panels. As this page progresses, the panel get smaller, and except for the last panel, blurrier and harder to follow.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n½ width, medium shot. The guy lunges back at Jason, catching him around the waist.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n½ width, medium shot. Jason and the guy, predictably, topple onto a nearby table.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Chaos begins to ensue. One of the other patrons takes a swing at Jason, which connects.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\n⅓ width, medium shot. The bartender, McSurley himself, ducks into the back room\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\n⅓ width, medium shot. It is at this point that the lines and colors begin to blur as this action sequence devolves. Multiple people are now slugging it out, with Jason in the center.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\n¼ width, wide shot. People are now clearing out of the bar and away from the brawl.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\n¼ width, medium shot. A blur of unclear action. Jason is in the midst of a brawl with the businessman and other unclear assailants.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\n¼ width. This panel is entirely black.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\n¼ width, medium shot. Jason stands alone above the now unconscious creep, fists at his side, breathing heavily. The table nearest him is broken. Some damage has been done.\n:::\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. The woman is also still here, arms folded across her chest. She seems irritated. Jason looks at her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou okay?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWOMAN\nI could have handled that myself.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up as Jason looks back at her. His expression is strangely blank.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYeah, but you didn’t have to.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up. The woman's expression does not soften.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWOMAN\nI could have handled that *without trashing the place*.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up. Jason looks moderately embarrassed, looking away.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYeah, well… yeah, okay.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason hands her a few hundreds. She looks surprised.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHere. Cover your losses.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWOMAN\nOh. I guess that makes you… Well, could've been worse, I guess.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. She leaves, speaking over her shoulder to Jason.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWOMAN\nI’m splitting before the cops show. You’d better do the same.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYeah, I will. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWELVE**\nFive panels, two rows of two and then a full width one.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jason looks around at the rapidly emptying bar. Marty and the TNT Brothers are nowhere to be found.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLooks like my targets have bounced, too. Not really a surprise.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason looks down at the unconscious creep, who’s dropped his wallet.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nUgh. She’s right. That was *dumb*. Million less messy ways I could’ve handled that. But I got angry, and then I got sloppy.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nStory of my life.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason looks around.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAnd now I gotta find my guys’ trail again.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on the guy's wallet, and next to it, a pair of car keys.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNo way. Is that --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nWide shot. Jason, still in civvies, is now driving a ‘56 Lincoln Continental that he has *very* clearly stolen from Creep.\n:::\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN**\nFive panels: see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFull width, medium shot. Jason frowns slightly as he looks at the wheel.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nDamn. Handling like a brick. That creep even take care of her?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Jason dials up a number on his phone while at a stoplight.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWell, don’t worry, girl. You’re in better hands now.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason is on the phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPHONE\n-- have reached the number 211-555-2924. Please leave a message at the tone.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHuh, guess he’s out of the shop. Weird.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nCharlie. Red here. I’m looking for parts to fix up a ‘56 Continental. Gonna swing by in the morning, so let me know if you can rustle anything up.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Jason re-pockets his phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGotta focus now, though. Lost their trail, but I've got a Plan B.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nFull width panel, wide shot. Jason drives through the city.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMcSurley's was neutral territory, but if they've been spooked, they'll want to go somewhere familiar to finish their business. If that's one of the TNT brother's places, I'm hosed. But they're new in town. So odds are, Marty will take them to one of his places. And I've been running surveillance on that chucklefuck since I *started* this.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jason pulls his car up outside of a worn-down apartment building.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMarty’s got a pad he uses when he needs to lay low. Gut’s telling me to check there.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Mind, my gut’s gotten me killed before, but --)\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of a beaten-up junker of a car parked outside the building.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThat’s Marty’s ride’s out front. I've hit paydirt.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason gets out of the car, sliding on his helmet as he moves.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nTime for a conversation with these gentlemen.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nWide shot. Jason ascends the building’s fire escape.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Jason slides open a window, gun in hand.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up as Jason's boots contact the ground.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLet's see how sharp these --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN**\nTwo panels\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nSplash page, wide shot. Marty and the TNT brothers lie dead on the floor. On the wall behind them, smeared in what seems to be blood, are the words “LET JUSTICE BE SERVED,” and below them, a crude rendition of a gavel.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nInset panel, lower right-hand corner, close-up. Jason stares at the scene in astonishment.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWait. What?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up. Jason kneels down, touching the bodies with a gloved hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI can’t have been more than a few minutes behind these guys. Whoever did this works fast. Killer was probably waiting for them when they got in.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of the bloody words on the wall.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMotivation isn’t exactly a mystery. Looks like Gotham’s got a new vigilante. One who’s not afraid to get their hands a little dirty.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason looks around.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot, same angle as before. Jason bursts out laughing.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Jason pops the front of his hood, wiping at an eye, because yes, he is laughing *that* hard.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAmazing. Fucking **amazing**. Someone in Gotham finally wises up, and it puts a hole right in my day. What the hell do I do now?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up. Jason looks around the room again, helmet still open.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI’d *like* to just call this good. But the TNT brothers have gotta have stashed their goods away somewhere. Gavel guy planning to take care of that one? I don’t even know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Jason rifles through one of the brothers' pockets.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n‘What we’ve got here is a failure to communicate!’\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Great. That’s gonna be stuck in my head all day now.)\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up. Jason turns on one of the phones he retrieved from the guy's pockets. There's a PIN number pad.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLocked. Of course. I'll have to try to crack it back at base.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot. Jason pockets the phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThat reminds me. Wonder if Charlie’s got back to me yet?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nEleven panels, see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n½ width. Close-up of Jason's own phone screen. He has 11 missed calls.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThe hell?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n½ width, medium shot. Jason puts his phone up to his ear. A series of messages sound over his phone over the course of the next several panels, each in their own jagged-edged speech bubbles.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nPHONE\n\"\"\"dialogue\nFirst new message from: Jordan\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPHONE\nHey, boss. You should know, Andy missed his drop-off today. On my way to his place, but you said to report if he stepped out of line, so.

LUIS DEL TORO is a tall, gangly Latino man with short dark hair, dark eyes, a goatee and a red jacket. JO TORÁIN is a short Eurasian woman with long, bushy, dark hair, dark eyes, a black denim jacket and a red newsboy cap. They’re standing with their heads towards each other, talking.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot from behind as Luis and Jo both whip around, pointing guns.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nWow, quite a party. What’s the occasion?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jason, his helmet closed again, as he stands in front of both of them.

Five of our guys are *dead*, is what happened! Where the hell were you?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nBusting up Mask's shit. See, I had this weird idea I was your boss, not your fucking babysitter. You can't take care of yourselves for three damn hours?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nSimilar to panel six, but Jo’s pointing at Jason, and Jason’s unfolded his arms, gesturing with a hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nThis wasn't normal shit.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nGreat. So tell me what it *was*.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Jo turns away, throwing up a hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nCalls started coming in about two hours ago. Near as I can tell, we lost five guys. Andy, Jordan, Kev, Leo, and Rex.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nAll today?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nNo. Three of 'em last night. We just heard about it when Luis started making the calls.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot. Jason turns his head towards Luis, who stands on Jason’s other side.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nWe sure that's all?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nHonestly, no. I called everyone I could, but everyone's layin' low. Can't blame 'em. I ain't never seen anythin' like this outside of -- well. You.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\nClose-up of Jason, who’s turned his head, apparently looking around.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHm.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN**\nSeven panels. As a nine-panel grid, but with one panel for the first row.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot, with Jason still looking around. He seems to be processing the size of the crowd for the first time. Most of them are shooting Jason curious glances.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nJesus. How many of us you cram in here?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Luis shrugs.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nI couldn't let 'em stay out there.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n'Cause it's such a better idea for everyone to cram themselves in like sitting ducks?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot as Jason addresses his gang, who look back at him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nEveryone go the hell home. Take tomorrow off and come back on Friday. I'll take care of this.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Jason's hand. He's holding a slip of paper out towards Luis and Jo.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHere. Got a new emergency line. Call me if anything urgent comes up. Don't use it unless something urgent comes up. I don't just go dark because I feel like it, y'know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason turns up the collar of his jacket, turning to leave.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nAnd Jo? Always nice to catch you in a good mood.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up as Jo snorts.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nSFX: SNRK\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nMake this fucker pay, and we'll talk good moods.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSFX: HEH\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Jason leaves.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jason in the parking lot, tossing his helmet in the back of his car.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot gonna lie… I hated these guys anyway.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason gets back in his stolen Continental.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nCan’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs. Can’t take over the Gotham Underworld without hiring some real dirtbags. And these guys were some pieces of work. They followed the rules, so I kept ‘em around. But honestly, I’d have killed ‘em myself given half a need.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason steers his car, driving.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo I’m not exactly crying to see them dead. But it is decidedly **inconvenient**.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nAnother medium shot of Jason behind the wheel.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI need to have a chat with 'Gavel' before things get out of hand. If I’m lucky, they’ll see reason. If not… well, then things get *interesting*.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Maybe I should just tip off Batman. Wouldn’t *that* be ironic?)\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Jason adjusts his rearview mirror, apparently thinking.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nFive of my guys, three of Mask's. Three last night, five today. Weird symmetry. Feels like I'm missing a pattern.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nCutaway/flashback shot, divided vertically, the left half a shot of Andy and Kev and the right of the TNT brothers.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAndy and Kev were brothers. Both killed last night, along with Rex. Trevor and Terry Brewer were brothers, too.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Back to Jason in the car.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThat's two sets of three, each two brothers and a third. But Jordan and Leo are only two, and neither of them had any siblings. Neither of them had anyone, really.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Jason drums his fingers on the wheel.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWell, I guess Jordan had Charlie. Recruited them together. About the only reason I gave Jordan as many chances as I did. Charlie's gonna be --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nClose-up as Jason's eyes go wide.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n**Charlie**.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE**\nFour panels: one row of three and one splash panel.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jason turns the wheel of the car sharply, drawing protesting honking from the car behind him.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide shot. Jason pulls his car outside of a chop shop intentionally reminiscent of the one from page one. There are lines for spaces, which he is not even close to following.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jason entering the door, as viewed from inside the shop. He has his domino mask on, but not his helmet.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nCharlie? Charlie?!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nSplash, wide shot. CHARLIE lies dead on the floor of his chop shop. Blood is everywhere, and sure enough, the words on the wall read \"LET JUSTICE BE SERVED\", the drawing of a gavel beneath. Jason can be seen from behind, staring at the scene.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n**No**.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO**\nFour panels.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason sags against the wall behind him, looking genuinely upset.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nDamn it. God damn it. **Why?**\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up. Jason puts a hand over his eyes.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThe other guys were fair. Pain in my ass, but I **got** it, y'know? But Charlie? Fuck, what the hell did he ever do? He was just a chop shopper. Never killed anyone, never laid a hand on anyone, never fucked with any kids. He didn't deserve this shit.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason sits with his hands folded in front of him, staring at the ground.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI know who it is now. It's the numbers. He's changed the pattern, but I still see it. Three sets of three. A pair and an odd one out. The familiar hiding in the unfamiliar. Because I know exactly who Charlie and Jordan used to work for, before I hired ‘em on. The same son of a bitch my father used to work for, before he killed him.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Jason's face as he looks up. He looks *pissed*.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n**Two-Face.**\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\nNEXT ISSUE: THE RED HOOD ON TRIAL…?","date":"2020-04-01T04:00:00.000Z","_id":"0357c6b41191482dbd073b43c0aa1e21"},{"title":"Seeing Double, Part II: Familiar Faces","series":"11b0a2fbad3d4dc8a2c60ec13d59594c","author":"1510047736564a5cb928d0bf18d6ff62","editor":"df18d55a94d546aaa2686cf40bb7a5fe","number":"2","content":"**PAGE ONE**\nFive panels, one full width and ½ height, one full width and ¼ height, and one row of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nOpen on BRUCE WAYNE in the BATCAVE.

It's Two-Face's Bat-computer file.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nYou never talk about him.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nTwo-shot of Bruce and a young JASON TODD. The latter is in his Robin uniform, mask off. Bruce has turned his chair around to look at Jason. Bruce's expression is carefully neutral; Jason's, a poorly schooled attempt at neutrality which doesn't really hide the conflicted emotions below it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE\nI'm… aware it's difficult for you.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up shot of Jason.

Before he, uh, y'know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWO**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up of Jason. He's fiddling with his glove, but he dares a glance up at Bruce, face still turned downwards. His expression is a poor attempt at a casual affect, like he's just asking about the weather or something.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nWhat was he like?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Bruce. He's not looking at Jason, either, staring off at a point in the distance. Remembering better times.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE\nHe was… a good man. The kind of man Gotham needed.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nYeah?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nFlashback panel. (Yes, I'm doing a flashback in a flashback. Shush.) HARVEY DENT poses on a DENT FOR DA poster, captioned PUT A DENT IN CRIME.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE (VOICEOVER)\nHe was intense. Driven. He seemed incorruptible. Everything his predecessor wasn't. And… he was my friend.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nSame as the previous panel, except now half of the poster has been burned and defaced.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (VOICEOVER)\nSo why'd he go bad?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE (VOICEOVER)\nIt's… complicated.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nBack to Bruce, who is still staring into the distance.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE\nPeople react to trauma in unpredictable ways.

Earlier.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nSame shot as the previous panel, but close-up on Jason's face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nDent woulda been the DA when my dad got locked up. He was the prosecutor. So that means… he took my dad away _twice._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nContinued close-up on Jason's face. He's smiling, but it's humorless and brittle. He does not look at all amused.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI just... it's funny. Right? It's-- it's funny.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE (OFFSCREEN)\nJason…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THREE**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot of Jason. He's shrugging, trying way too hard to look unbothered.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI get it, y'know? He was… I mean. He was a bad guy, right? He stole cars and stuff, it wasn't like he was there a lot anyway… I just... it's just….\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE (OFFSCREEN)\nJason.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nTwo-shot of Jason and Bruce. Bruce puts a hand on Jason's shoulder, kneeling to be at eye level.

He's staring at Bruce.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou think… you think he's ever going to go good again?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Bruce. He's looking at Jason, almost willing him to get it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE\nI don't know. I hope so.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nWhy? I mean… what if it's too late?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose shot shot of Bruce. He sighs as he lowers his hand. (SFX: sigh).\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE\nI know what he's done. I'm sorry. About your father. But...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose shot of Bruce.

Do you understand?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up on Jason. He's not looking at Bruce.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHey. It's almost time for patrol, right? We should get going.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up of Bruce. He looks a little concerned, and a little unsure.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nSame shot as panel eight.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBRUCE\n… yes. We should.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOUR**\nFour panels, one full width and ¾ height, and one row of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide interior shot of JASON'S WORKSHOP. It looks to be a smallish, once-abandoned warehouse, now turned into a work area. The walls are lined with WEAPONRY of various sorts. Rows of cheap plastic tables and shelves are scattered around the concrete floor, piled with a mix of papers, blueprints, surveillance photos, gadgetry in various states of repair, and more weapons. In the back corner is what appears to be a makeshift living area, complete with a mattress sitting directly on the concrete floor, a small bookshelf and some type of electric heating plate. The figure of JASON TODD stands at the table nearest the bed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION BLURB\nNow.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI haven't really thought about Two-Face in years.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot of Jason. We see that he's got a cheap LAPTOP in front of him. Behind the laptop is a MAP OF GOTHAM, stuck with pins. Beside the laptop is a haphazard stack of papers and photos. From the few we can see, they're Two-Face-related. I'd call it organized chaos, but \"organized\" is probably overselling it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nFunny, for how much he shaped my life. Weren't for him, I wouldn't've had to take care of Mom alone. Would've had someone when she died. Wouldn't have met Bruce. Wouldn't have been Robin.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium side shot. Jason's looking at one of the photos from the pile, some surveillance camera footage of Two-Face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut I don't think about him much anymore. Maybe it makes me a bad son. But the guy who killed your father starts to seem a lot less important compared to the guy who killed _you_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on some of the photos on the table. They appear to be crime-scene-type photographs from Dent's previous targets. The words \"Let justice be served\" are written on the wall in all of them.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut that's changed now. Because Dent's decided to try to play hero again. And he's doing it by killing _my_ gang.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIVE**\nSix panels, a row of two, a row of three, and a full-width panel.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up on Jason's face. He's got a hand to his chin, looking deep in thought.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI _do_ get the irony, by the way. Like I'm one to talk about killing criminals, right? Hell, some of my guys who Dent got even deserved it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on one of the pictures. It's the interior of Charlie's chop shop from issue one. There's blood everywhere.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut not all of them.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nAnother close-up of Jason's face. He's staring down at something that seems to have caught his attention.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLook. Willis Todd was a shitty father. Walked out on us all the time. Spent half my childhood behind bars. But he didn’t deserve what Two-Face gave him. Neither did Charlie.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on two sheets of paper, side by side. It looks like some type of financial transaction records.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAnd I have worked TOO DAMN HARD to let Dent ruin it all because his coin came up the wrong right way.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nExtreme close-up on the papers, two transactions in clear focus. Jason's finger hovers next to one of the lines.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLINE ONE\nWithdrawal: $2222\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLINE TWO\nDeposit: $2222\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Jason, his expression focused and hard.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo if it’s war that Dent wants? Then he’s gonna fucking get it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIX**\nFive panels, one full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide exterior shot of a run-down apartment building. A speech bubble originates from a figure in one of the windows.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (VO)\nY'ever get the feeling like you're missing something?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (VO)\nLike you've got everything you need just staring you in the face, and you can't quite put it together?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nInterior medium shot of Jason, leaning on the sill of an open window, staring outside. He's in his Red Hood gear, helmet on the windowsill beside him. Our angle is behind him, but we can see cigarette smoke curling up and out.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nBeen driving me nuts all day. Just can't shake it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nTurn 180 degrees to a medium shot of LAWRENCE LUKEN, a tall, burly blond man in a faded red jacket. He looks extremely uncomfortable and more than slightly nervous.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nI thought you said you got a break, right?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium side shot of Jason. We can see the edge of his domino mask, but not much of his face. We can also see his shoulders as he shrugs.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI figured out it was Two-Face hitting us, if that's what you mean. But I still don't know where he is. Best I've got is that he seems to be going for our guys who were _his_ guys.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nBack to a close-up of Lawrence. There's sweat beading around his hairline.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nSo, uh… y'think I might be next, then? Y'know, if he's targeting us…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVEN**\nSeven panels, a row of three, a full-width panel, and a row of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nAnother side-shot of Jason. He stares out the window, not answering, taking a drag from his cigarette.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nJason turns slightly, cigarette raised. We can only see a part of his face, his expression unreadable from this angle.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou smoke, Lawrence?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Lawrence. He shakes his head.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nNo. Uh, nah, boss.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nShame.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nBack to Jason, staring out the window.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nKind of lives we lead, it's not the smokes that'll get us. Why not have our vices while we're here, right?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nBack to a medium shot of Lawrence. He looks EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nUh…\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nSee, the thing I just can't figure out is… how the hell did Two-Face find so many of us so quick?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium two-shot of Jason and Lawrence. We see Jason still standing in the window, smoking. Behind him, Lawrence reaches for a gun in his waistband.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nIt's weird. Almost like he has …\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose two-shot. Suddenly, Jason has whipped around, and is now pressing his knife to Lawrence's throat.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n… a double agent.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHT**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose two-shot of Jason and Lawrence. Jason is smiling, but it's cold, completely humorless.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nDrop the gun, Lawrence.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Lawrence's hand. The gun clatters to the ground (SFX: clatter) as he drops it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nGood.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Lawrence. By this point, he looks desperately terrified.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nPlease, I -- I had to!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nIs that so.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nMy -- it was my sister. He threatened her, I didn't have no choice --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Jason. His expression is cold, lips thin in a mocking smirk.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nAnd you didn't tell me? Lawrence. I am _hurt_. You think I can't take _Two-Face_?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE (OFFSCREEN)\nI couldn't -- couldn't take the chance! She's my little sis!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nAnother close-up. Jason looks entirely unaffected by Lawrence's pleading.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nKev, Andy, Jordan, Leo, and Rex… you have made _quite_ a mess.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSo let's talk about fixing it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Lawrence's surprised face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nAny other time, you'd be choosing right now between a slow death and a quick one. But for family? Fine. I get it. So here is the deal.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up from the front of Jason's intense expression.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou will give me Dent. Everything you have on him. And then you will get out of Gotham. Tonight. Take your sister and live your life somewhere else. Five of us are dead because of you. But as long as I _never_ see your face again, you won't be number six. _Got it_?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nLawrence nods as vigorously as he can with a knife to his throat.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nGood.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium two-shot. Jason gestures to the nearby chair with his knife.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSit.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINE**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Jason straddles the seat across from Lawrence, chair positioned backwards. He rests both arms on the back, the knife with the hand still pointing in Lawrence's general direction.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI just need a location, Lawrence. Just tell me where to find him, and we never have to see each other again.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Lawrence. His face is practically raining sweat at this point, his eyes darting to the side.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nS-see, the thing is, I n-never actually w-went to where he was holed up --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nAnother close-up of Lawrence, but this time the tip of Jason's knife is pressing just against the skin under his left eye, millimeters from the eye itself. Lawrence is TERRIFIED.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nRemind me. I said I'd let you live. Did I say it'd be in _one piece_?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nAh! Ah, wait, there was -- I, uh -- I never _went_ there, but, uh, he talked about it a few times…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nFlashback panel. Lawrence stands in ROBINSON PARK, beside a statue. In the statue's shadow stands the silhouette of HARVEY DENT, nothing further able to be seen.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE (VO)\nHe'd talk about going, uh, back down to his chambers? Is that anythin'? That could mean south or somethin', right? Uh, I think I saw his car --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (VO)\nWait.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nBack to a two-shot of Jason and Lawrence, Jason staring at him intently.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHis \"chambers?\"\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nYeah. That's what he called it.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nNot \"hideout\" or \"safehouse?\" Chambers? Are you sure?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLAWRENCE\nY-yeah. Yes! Yeah, I'm sure!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nTwo-shot. Jason stares at Lawrence.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nChambers? DAs have _offices_, not chambers.

Of _course._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot of Lawrence, who sits there looking unspeakably relieved.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nThanks. You've been a big help.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot. Lawrence turns to look towards Jason.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nOh. One last thing.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TEN**\nSeven panels, one full-width and two rows of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Lawrence sits in his chair, doubled over, face pained. Both of his hands clutching his throat, where Jason's KNIFE is now embedded.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Jason from below. His face is cold, and his eyes strangely blank.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI know _damn well_ you don't have a sister.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nTwo-shot. Jason watches impassively as Lawrence falls to the ground, clutching his throat. The bloodied knife is now back in Jason's hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou sold us out just to line your wallet. And you didn't even have the guts to own it, instead of spinning bullshit sob stories. Well, hey…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jason turns, sliding his helmet back on.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nTurns out I can lie, too.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nShot of the door as Jason leaves.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nShot from the outside of the apartment as Jason walks out.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWhat a mess. But at least it's almost over now.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium exterior shot. Jason's getting into his stolen Continental from issue one. The sun is very low in the sky now, almost dusk.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nTime for Dent's day in court.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN**\nSeven panels, a full-width panel and two rows of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nExterior shot of the SOLOMON WAYNE COURTHOUSE. At one point, it must have been a grand building, with tall windows, gleaming white marble, a statue of Lady Justice carved onto the gable above the entrance, and a statue of a horse on a pillar beside it. Now, however, it is badly damaged by both time and natural disaster.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBeen a while since this place has seen people. Way I remember it, the foundation got split open back during the Cataclysm. Cheaper to rebuild than repair.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium exterior shot as Jason slips in through a small window in the cupola.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThey should've sprung for demolition, too.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose shot of a set of BLOODY FOOTPRINTS on the checkered tile floor.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nShit. That's fresh. Dent is here. And he's been busy.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nWide shot. Jason rounds a corner. He's near the entrance to the courtroom, a door downstairs to his immediate left. Stretching out of the basement door is the long shadow of a second figure.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOne of mine? One of Mask's? Either way, gonna be his last--\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason narrowly dodges to the side as a set of MAGNETIC CUFFS fly past him. If you've seen the Judgement Day episode of TNBA, you may remember what I'm referencing; otherwise, know that they're a pair of self-guided, large metal shackles which can be fired to lock around someone's wrists or ankles, then pull together automatically.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot of Dent's shadow, slipping back downstairs.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThere!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up on Jason's pistols as he opens fire.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWELVE**\nSeven panels, two rows of two and a row of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason stands in the hallway now, back pressed to the wall, peering through the door frame.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNo return fire. He trying to keep this quiet, or…?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose on Jason's helmeted face as he peers around the corner to the basement, gun at the ready.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHe's fast. Gotta be careful --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jason. There's a magnetic cuff around one of his wrists, but he's pulled the other one out of the way in time.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot as Jason looks down at his one cuffed wrist.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nDamn! Even faster'n I thought. Least he can't do much with just one--\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason spasms as electricity arcs through him, originating from the cuff.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot as Jason falls to the floor. The silhouetted feet of HARVEY DENT stand next to him. The text in Jason's internal monologue bubble gets smaller and fainter from left to right.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOr… maybe… he… can...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nThis panel is entirely black.\n:::\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN**\nSix panels, three rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot on Jason, kneeling on a tile floor with both his arms and legs bound behind his back. He has his domino mask, but his helmet is missing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWhere…?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason squints and ducks his head as a series of BRIGHT LIGHTS flick on.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT (OFFSCREEN)\nRed Hood.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nWide shot of a silhouetted Harvey Dent, spotlight behind him. We can now see that this is a COURTROOM, Dent before the judge's bench.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAh.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Dent. He's still just a shadow against the light.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nYou stand accused of theft, smuggling, bribery, extortion, arms trafficking, drug trafficking, election fraud...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose shot of Jason's confused expression.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nElection fraud? When did I --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT (OFFSCREEN)\nVandalism, counterfeiting, reckless endangerment, racketeering, assault, battery, arson …\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOh, right. Yeah, I guess that counts.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\n… and **murder**.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN**\nTwo panels, a splash panel and an inset panel in the lower right corner.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nSplash panel. DENT stands, revealed at last. It's not too far off of his Judge look from TNBA, but there's some definite differences. His robes are judge's robes, but with golden pauldrons, joined to a golden belt by equally gilded rope. The overall effect is something like an upside-down set of scales. As for his face, it's covered entirely by a mask -- smooth, reflective gold, like a statue. There are no apparent eyeholes. In his hand, he holds a sword, pointed down towards the viewer.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nHow do you plead?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up reaction shot of Jason.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHonestly... I'm gonna need to itemize.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN**\nFour panels. Panel one runs up the full height of the left ⅔ of the page, while panels two through four are stacked atop each other in the right ⅓.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nTwo-shot. Dent sits at the Judge's bench, Jason kneeling below. Jason's internal monologue bubbles are all arranged on the left, and the dialogue on the right.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nTied up. I'm guessing those electric cuffs from earlier. But why do they seem so familiar?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nThe accused may speak in his defense.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWait. I know what these are. They use them for riot control at Arkham. \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou forgot \"obscene conduct.\"\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n**Waynetech design.**\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nThe accused has spoken.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOops.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Jason.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHang on, the accused isn't finished yet!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGotta stall. Get these cuffs off. Then get Dent.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT (OFFSCREEN)\nVery well. Make your excuses.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nSimilar shot to panel two, but with a much darker expression on Jason.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n_Excuses_?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nJason lowers his head and LAUGHS (SFX: HA!).\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nOh, that is _rich_ coming from _you_.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSure. I've done some shit. Had my reasons, yeah, but I know I've fucked up plenty. But YOU?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN**\nFive panels, one full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up. Jason looks up at Harvey, defiant.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou are a _piece of work_, Dent. \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT (OFFSCREEN)\nTwo-Face is not on trial now.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHe fucking SHOULD BE!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Jason’s snarling face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nLook at you! Mr. District Attorney! Fuck you! Ruining our damn lives even when you try to do _good_!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nTell me. How many of my gang have you killed?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up, low angle of Dent’s blank mask.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nHow many have YOU?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nFlashback panel to Jason killing Lawrence.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up of Jason, looking down.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nThat's different.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT (OFFSCREEN)\nIs it?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nSeven panels, two rows of three and a full-width panel.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot of Dent, low angle. He’s walking out from behind the judge’s podium.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nIt's time to render the verdict.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nShit. Out of time.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Dent’s expressionless mask.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nRed Hood. The court finds you **guilty** on all charges.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot, from behind. Jason looks behind him at the cuffs. He has a pick in one hand, but does not seem to have finished opening the cuffs by a large margin.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLost my temper. Lost my focus.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up as Jason looks back up at Dent.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAbout to lose my head.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nTwo-shot, angled from behind Jason as Dent stands over him, sword in hand. We can see his hands behind him, but the cuffs themselves are offscreen.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nThe sentence --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nC'mon, c'mon, _c'mon_ --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up as Dent swings his sword.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\n... is **death**!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium two-shot.

Jason dodges backwards out of the way as Dent slashes with his sword, barely missing Jason’s chest.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou want my Goddamn _defense_?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nJason lunges towards Dent, slashing with his own weapon towards Dent’s throat, only for it to be blocked by Dent’s sword.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot of Jason and Dent, blades locked.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nY'think I do this for _kicks_? _Fuck_ you! I do this because it is the! Only! Way! To take Gotham back from people like _you_! Why do YOU do this? Because your fucking COIN tells you to?!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose shot of Dent. He shoves Jason’s knife away with a heavy push on his sword.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\n_NOT ANYMORE_!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nWide shot. Dent’s swinging his sword in a wide arc, while Jason backflips away from Dent, knife still in hand as he does so.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nI know who you are, Hood! You think you're so _different_! But look at you and Harvey! Both just another pair of Batman's partners who he failed! Who went bad!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Jason as he lands.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou've been listening to some bad rumors, Dent.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nDent stalks towards Jason, sword at the ready.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nDid you think I wouldn’t recognize you?! After all the times you fought Two-Face? I know you! The second Robin!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot of Jason as he blocks another of Dent’s swings, grimacing. Looks like this was a close one.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nBut now, you're just another criminal!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nClose-up as Dent raises his sword for an overhand swing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nFace it. You and Two-Face… you're two of a kind!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nTwo-shot. Jason dodges to the side, out of the way of Dent’s sword, and cuts a clean line up Dent’s sword arm with his knife.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nSFX: ARGH!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nAnd what are YOU?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium front shot of Dent. He’s clutching his wounded arm, shoulders slumped but staring straight ahead.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nI'm what Gotham needs!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nDent raises his sword in front of him, like a fencer.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nTwo-Face was evil! Harvey was weak! But I'm not! I'll be better!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nJason faces back towards Dent, knife also at the ready. He LAUGHS.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSFX: Hahaha!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nGod. That's why me, isn't it? All your old crew I brought in. Your little parallels. You think I'm _you_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Jason’s intense expression.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSo this is, what? Some type of attempt to reinvent yourself? Destroy everything that came before? That's why you're killing 'em _all_?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nWide two-shot. Jason and Dent both look around as SIRENS ring through the air (SFX: weeOOweeOOweeOO)\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSirens.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nAnother close-up of Jason, looking at Dent with renewed focus.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI'd _like_ to think those are unrelated to those shots I fired earlier. But it _sounds_ to me like we are running out of time.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou think YOU'RE different?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium action shot. Dent and Jason resume their fight, blades locking.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nMaybe you switched things up a bit, but you're still just the same! You and your damn numbers! The set of two and the odd one out, right? Black Mask. Me. And _Two-Face_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nClose-up two-shot of Jason and Dent, both leaning on their weapons with full force, faces inches apart.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nEven when you try to change, some things stay the same. Right?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN**\nSeven panels, a full-width panel and two rows of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nTwo-shot. Jason stumbles backwards, knife flying from his hand as Dent overpowers him, flinging his sword wide.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nSHUT UP!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nShot of Jason, lying on the ground. He’s disarmed and bleeding from a cut to his cheek, but he’s smiling in dark amusement.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nOh my God. You don't even realize you're doing it, do you? That's just -- sad.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Dent looms over Jason, sword to his throat.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDENT\nIt -- it doesn't matter! Everything that was Two-Face's must be destroyed! EVERYTHING!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-shot. Jason reaches into his jacket.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYeah?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nDent dives for cover as Jason opens fire.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHappy to help.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot of Jason firing, but this time, his gun appears to be either jammed or empty, dry-firing (SFX: klik klik!)\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot as Jason discards his empty guns.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nJason lunges towards Dent. Just his bare hands now against Dent’s sword, but he seems unfazed.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nTwo-shot of Jason and Dent. Jason’s hands are over his head, hands up against Dent’s wrist, blocking the latter’s attempt at a downward chop with his sword. There’s neither dialogue nor monologue, but this panel represents our first appearance of MEMORY TEXT, white text overlayed over the background without a speech bubble.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nMEMORY TEXT\nHow many of my gang have you killed?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nJason twists Dent’s wrists to the side, knocking the sword clear of his grip.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nMEMORY TEXT\nHow many have YOU?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nJason yanks Dent downwards by the wrists as he knees him in the stomach.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nMEMORY TEXT\nI’d have killed ‘em myself given half a need.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nJason kicks Dent in the face, sending him reeling backwards.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nMEMORY TEXT\nI'm what Gotham needs!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nDent stumbles backwards, both hands over his face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nMEMORY TEXT\nI'm doing what you won't!

The shot is very reminiscent of a similar panel from Batman 411.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nOver-the-shoulder shot of Jason as he chokes Harvey.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI'll kill you!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nMEMORY TEXT\nWhen someone means something to you, you can't just give up on them.

What I wouldn’t give for some _real_ sleep.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWO**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason, stil shirtless, pours himself coffee in the middle of… it’s not really a “kitchen” so much as it is an area of his workshop that has a table with a few plugged-in appliances on it. A window in the background shows it’s late in the day… 3, maybe 4.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot sure I’ve had a decent night’s rest since the Pit. But it’s been a _lot_ worse lately.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason’s slumped on a beaten couch in the corner, holding his mug in one hand and rubbing at an eye with the other. There’s dark circles under his eyes. There’s also a small TV in the corner, blaring light.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nCan’t shut my head up. Thinking about things I haven't thought about since before I died. Thinking about things I've _been_ thinking about since I came back. Not sure why. If it’s just the shit with Dent, or just… I don’t know…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose shot on the TV. A smiling blonde woman runs through a grassy meadow. Generic pharmaceutical ad stuff. Text across the screen represents the brand label for PANACEA.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTV\nToday is the day that miracles can happen. By unlocking the body’s ability to heal itself --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nSame shot as before, except now the TV is turning off, Jason’s hand in the foreground holding the remote. His fingers are notably extremely scarred up.\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"dialogue\nOh, fuck _off_.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Jason, scowling.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nTired of seeing this snake oil everywhere. “A modern miracle.” _Please_. There’s no _miracles_ in this shitty world.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Jason’s coffee mug. He’s staring down at it, holding it in his hand, but the muddied reflection of his face in the surface is wrong… younger, with a strange, wild expression. The background of the reflection looks not like the interior of Jason’s crappy living area, but like the interior of some underground area, almost like a temple.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n_Everything_ has a cost.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot, with the camera at the table. Jason’s walking away from the couch, coffee mug still sitting on the table.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nChrist. Enough of this maudlin bullshit.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THREE**\nFour panels. A 1/2-height, full-width panel, a row of two, and a full-width panel.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot of an OFFICE BUILDING. It looks like it could be just about any skyscraper in downtown Gotham, albeit a fairly high-end one. We’re not to sunset yet, but the sun’s definitely made its way pretty far across the sky.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n… I’ve got _work_ to do.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nInterior shot of an EXECUTIVE OFFICE. It’s a nice-looking setup. Spacious, with windows for days, overlooking the city. Plush white carpeting. Mahogany desk. Tall, black leather chair. Wooden shelves lined with expensive-looking showpieces, mostly marble busts and various masks. Someone has made himself _very_ comfortable here. In the chair near the windows sits the figure of a man, holding a phone up to his ear. He’s facing away from the reader.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nFIGURE\n***WHAT?***\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nZoom in closer on the figure. We still can’t see his face, just the edge of a WHITE SUIT, a phone held in a gloved hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nFIGURE\n**YOU SAID THE SHIPMENT CAME IN LAST NIGHT!**\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nThe figure has now turned around, slamming his fist on the desk. We can see his face now, and it’s not a pretty sight… rather than a normal face, he appears to be wearing a dark, skeletal mask, horribly fused in places to his skin. It’s BLACK MASK. And he is _not_ happy.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBLACK MASK\n***WHAT DO YOU MEAN, \"BLANKS?!\"***\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI really shouldn't be enjoying this as much as I am.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOUR**\nEight panels. The layout of this one is a bit complicated. The first panel of the page is a large one, but rather than the normal rectangle, the bottom comes to a point at the center, leading down into the second panel. The second panel is in the center of the page, serving as the focal point. It’s shaped like a somewhat simplified skull, mirroring Black Mask’s, er, mask. The remaining panels are oriented around the mask, starting with #3 to the left of panel 2 and proceeding downwards, then wrapping up around to start panel 6 to the right of panel 2. The internal monologue bubbles are positioned strategically around the page between panels to guide the reader’s eye naturally in the correct reading order.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nAnother shot of Black Mask’s office building, but this time, the angle is a bit different. Specifically, we’re viewing it from a rooftop across the street, from the shadows of a water tower. More specifically, we’re viewing it from over the shoulder of a figure seated beside it. He’s wearing a leather jacket and a red domino mask. On the rooftop next to him is a dark red helmet, a 7/11 slurpee and a half-eaten sandwich. You know full well who this is. And he’s clearly failing badly to suppress laughter, the back of one fist to his mouth.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nY'ever meet someone you just _love_ to hate? Someone the whole world’d be better without? Someone who is such _human garbage_ that every time you ruin their day, it makes yours just that much better?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWell, for me, that's Black Mask.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nThe skull panel. We see the figure of a younger ROMAN SIONIS, face unmarred. Almost handsome, even. Wavy brown hair, intense brown eyes, hands in his pockets. The picture of a confident businessman, except for a glint of something darker in his expression. The background is just sheets of money.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nRoman Sionis. The rich boy who could never have ENOUGH.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nWide shot of the old Sionis mansion, burning. In the foreground, we see the lower half of a figure in a white suit, watching the fire. He’s holding a can of gasoline in one hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nIced his own parents for the inheritance. When he ran their company into the ground, he turned to money laundering for the mob to keep his _trust fund_ filled. When Wayne Enterprises shut THAT down, he turned to revenge.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Roman Sionis at his desk. His office is much like the one we saw in the previous page, and his pose is, too, screaming angrily into a phone as he pounds his desk. The background, though, is not the walls of his office, but another more abstract background, a collage of plummeting stock charts and “SIONIS INDUSTRIES BANKRUPT” headlines.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nWide shot of a Sionis Industries board meeting, executives gathered around a table. Bruce Wayne sits at one end, looking full Brucie: wide, innocent grin, though with a hint of genuine pleasure in his eyes. At the other end of the table, Sionis storms out, furious.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nWide shot. Roman Sionis now wears his Black Mask mask, addressing a crowd of equally masked gang members. His False Face Society. Unlike the more recent shots, his mask is clearly still separable from the rest of his face, not yet fused on. From the background, they look to be outside a mausoleum of some sorts.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGot himself a mask, then got himself a following. The False Face society. THEN he got his dumb ass caught on fire, got his mask fused to his face.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nWide shot. Black Mask and the False Face Society invade a society gala. Wealthy, panicked socialites running about everywhere. Sharp-eyed readers may recognize the interior as Wayne Manor, but if they don’t, then they might spot the figure of Bruce Wayne slipping away at the edge of the scene, a shorter, black-haired figure beside him.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Roman Sionis burns, fire consuming and melting the mask on his face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI should know...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIVE**\nEight panels. A mirrored setup of page two, with the notable difference that instead of the figure of a skull as panel two, it’s the outline of the Red Hood’s helmet.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nOver-the-shoulder shot from Black Mask's perspective. It's a low angle, as he's on the ground. The figure of Roman Sionis is pulled free from the flames by a rope around his ankles, clawing at the ground. Above him stands the figure of ROBIN, pulling him to safety.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nIt was _my_ dumb ass that pulled him out of the fire in the first place.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nThe helmet-shaped panel. In the center of the panel stands the figure of ROBIN, THE BOY WONDER. Bright colors, brilliant grin, cracking his knuckles. The backdrop of the panel is a bright yellow, with a black Bat-symbol immediately behind him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBack when I was Robin. Back when I still BELIEVED in Batman.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot. Remember the cover of Batman 408? Basically that. Young Jason, the street rat, is looking up in surprise at the figure of BATMAN behind him, Jason dropping the tire he was in the middle of stealing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBack before the Joker. The crowbar. The bomb.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium two-shot. BATMAN AND ROBIN swing through the air, side by side. As it always should have been.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot. BATMAN AND ROBIN stand, backs to each other, arms folded. A distance between them.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nPOV shot, from Jason’s perspective, of the Joker, swinging a crowbar down towards the camera. Blood splashes up in the foreground, framing the green glove on a hand raised fruitlessly in attempted defense. In the background, a blonde woman stands, smoking, not looking at the camera.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBack in my FIRST LIFE.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nThis panel is confused and abstract. Swirling, poisonous green dominates the panel, surrounding a hand raised through the liquid in mirror of the sixth panel, only this time the hand is bare, the sleeve of a suit below it. Somehow, through the liquid, the face of TALIA AL GHUL is visible.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. The figure of the Red Hood, helmet on, stands, one hand on a railing, an AK-47 in the other, looking down below. You know the shot I’m referencing here.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWell.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIX**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nBack to Jason on the rooftop. Medium front shot. He’s holding a pair of binoculars up to his face with one hand, and eating his sandwich with the other, as you do.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThings are a little DIFFERENT now.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nDistant shot of Black Mask through his office window. He's still ranting into his phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nPlanted the bug in his office about three days ago. Quite a SHOW so far, but nothing USEFUL.. But I think tonight might be the night.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nSide shot of Jason looking through his binoculars.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAbout damn TIME, too. Meet’s just after sunset. I’ve got the time, but not the location. But I think he’s about to spill. Thank GOD.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI could use something SIMPLE right now.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Black Mask at his desk. He hasn’t calmed down, exactly, but he appears to be back to business.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBLACK MASK\nI swear to God, you better not fuck up the handoff tomorrow, or I’m gonna feed you your own --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nCome on, come on…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nSimilar shot to panel four, with Mask gesticulating wildly with his free hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBLACK MASK\n-- and then when I’m done with that --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOh my God, give me the damn location --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nSimilar shot to the previous two panels. Mask stands, jabbing one finger into the desk.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBLACK MASK\n-- and all the other brain donors you call security staff will be a _permanent_ damn part of the Domino’s foundation! _Do I make myself clear?!_\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n_There_ we go.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVEN**\nSix panels. Panel three is a splash panel taking up the top ⅔ of the page, with panels one, two, four and five in each corner. The sixth panel is a full-width panel in the bottom ⅓ of the page.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up of a grapnel firing (SFX: FSSH).\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of a grappling hook, grabbing a concrete ledge.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nSplash panel. Jason, helmet now back on, grapples through the Gotham skyline, rooftops behind him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThe Domino. _That’s_ his new tradeoff point. Should have _known_. Construction’s been going on _suspiciously_ long, but I’d had it pegged as a Broker project. Safe money that whatever his new shipment is, it’ll be there.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up (such as it is) of the sun. It’s definitely late in the evening, the sun sinking lower and lower, but we’ve got some time yet before nightfall.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThat’s not until _tonight_, though. Which leaves me with a couple hours to kill.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up of Jason’s booted feet as he touches down on a rooftop, knees bent.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nReally need to go over the books soon. But I’m too damn tired for _numbers_ today. Focus is shot. Sleep’s _not_ happening. No. What I _really_ need…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nWide shot. Jason hops over the edge of the building he’s landed on, continuing to rooftop hop. Behind him on a nearby rooftop is a large BILLBOARD. On it is a smiling woman, holding up a vial of a clear liquid. Text on it reads “PANACEA: THE CURE FOR WHAT AILS YOU.”\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n… is something to _hit_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHT**\nFive panels, one full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nCutaway to a wide shot of the interior of the RED HOOD BASE. We’ve been here before. It looks a lot less frantic than when we last saw it, though. Mostly empty, but not deserted, a few Red Hoods scattered about here and there. Gang colors are black, white and red. Black jackets and red hoodies and hats feature prominently. Five Hoods sit around a flimsy card table, playing, unsurprisingly, cards. Two of them are LUIS DEL TORO and JO TORÁIN.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nThe _Domino_, really?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Luis. His cards are in his hand, and he’s staring at them contemplatively, planning his next move.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nDamn. Was _sure_ that was gonna be Two-Face’s.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Jo. Her cards are in her hand, but she’s not looking at them, instead glaring at Luis.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nMan, do not even joke about that. Too damn soon.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Luis. He’s pushing more money into the center of the table.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nRight, sorry.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nRaise.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nWide shot of the table. We can see some of the other Red Hoods here, including one TYLER JEFFERSON, a tall, heavily built white man. Blond hair, green eyes. He's wearing a sleeveless leather vest and t-shirt, revealing heavily tattooed arms.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nSo we're hittin' 'em tonight? We gonna have the boss along?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nDidn't say.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nReally? We’ve got what, two hours?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nYou know how it is.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nRight.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINE**\nEight panels: one row of four, one full-width, and one row of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up.

But he could fuckin' show more often, is all I'm sayin'.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up. Luis looks at his cards.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nNot like Mask's gonna be at this handoff, either. He's out there more often than any other boss I've had. We all gotta pull our own weight.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up. Tyler stares towards Jo.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nJo?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up. Jo looks at her cards. Her expression is unreadable.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nI say…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot of Jo, putting her cards down on the table. She's got a straight flush.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nCall.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nWide shot of the gang sitting around the table.

It's an exclusive-looking club, nestled amidst a series of boarded up or otherwise dilapidated buildings that seem anything but.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO (VO)\nWe're all just looking for that one big break.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nInterior wide shot of the Masquerade. Specifically, the back room. Jason is in the middle of brawling with five men. Four bouncers and one cop. There's a pile of small baggies filled with white powder on a table in the center.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThis _isn't_ for the hell of it. Just so we're clear.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot.

Steady stream of locals, half of ‘em homeless? Some of ‘em _kids_? At this point it’s not even “obvious drug ring”; it’s “obvious _bait_.”\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nJason opens fire from cover behind the table. His opponents scatter, diving for cover of their own.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut hey, what you call a “trap,” I call “unknown security measures.” And Black Mask has yet to come up with any of _those_ I can’t handle.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up of Jason.

Its borders lack any outline and are jagged in shape, carrying the effect of an explosion of light.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide action shot. Jason is just wrecking the remaining bouncers,  The colors on this one are still washed out and overexposed, as though the light is just clearing.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium action shot. Jason’s leaping through the air, both feet connecting with the chest of Bouncer #3.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium action shot. Jason bangs together the heads of Bouncer #3 and the cop.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nOkay!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot, worm’s-eye view.

We did what you wanted! You’ll let us live, right?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Jason. We still can’t see his face, but his head is tilted to the side, and his gun is still raised.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nY’know something? I’ve been having my _doubts_ lately. Trying to _cut back_. But...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot of the two now-dead bouncers, both with gunshot wounds in their chest.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nYou sold drugs to _kids_.

Jason points his gun back at Bouncer #3.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nLet’s go.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN**\nEight panels, one full-width, a row of three, and a row of four.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason and Bouncer #3, still at gunpoint, walk out of the club. Through the door behind them, we can clearly see that it’s currently empty. We can also see Jason tossing what is clearly a GRENADE through the door behind him.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide shot. Jason and the Bouncer walk towards a nearby alleyway. In the distance behind them, we can clearly see a FIRE beginning to take hold of the Masquerade building.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI could’ve timed this little DETOUR better. Thought I had all the time I needed. But I’ve got maybe half an hour to get across town before Mask’s handoff. Cutting it _real_ close.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHow far?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBOUNCER #3\nNot far.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nRight now, about the only question I have is whether or not this guy _knows_ he’s leading me into a trap.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jason, looking around the alley suspiciously. It appears pretty ordinary so far, except for how unusually far back it seems to go.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNo sign of an ambush… what am I missing here?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nWide shot. Jason and Bouncer #3 come into a small courtyard. There’s room enough for maybe a dozen people, if they really squeeze together. The edges of the courtyard are full of litter and the general scattered detritus of a city, but the center is strangely clean.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBOUNCER #3\nHere.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nWhat, this?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nNot exactly the _smoking gun_ you made it sound like. \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBOUNCER #3\nYou’re supposed to be a smart guy, right?

Spread the word about your Rules and all that?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nYou done answering my fucking questions yet?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot of Jason. He’s crouching to look at the ground, gun still trained on Bouncer #3.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSee some footsteps… hard to tell. It’s rained recently. But I’m seeing a bunch here. And… what is that…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up of what is clearly a crack in the stone, as though for a large trapdoor.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n… oh, hell.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN**\nFive panels, four in a grid on the left ⅔ of the page, and one long one running up the right side of the page.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Bouncer #3, expression a mix of relief and  satisfaction, presses his hand against the wall of a nearby building. It is CLEARLY a button.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nJason lunges forward, trying to get clear of the trapdoor as it opens up, but it’s large, almost the entire size of the courtyard.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jason, falling. He’s grabbing in his jacket.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nJason POV shot of the courtyard trapdoor, closing above him. His grappling hook clinks (SFX: CLNK) ineffectively against the stone.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nJason falls through blackness. The background is dark, but there’s a slight gradient, a faintly greenish light at the bottom.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOkay. _Now_ I get it, yeah.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nSeven panels, one full-width and two rows of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot of Jason, connecting heavily with some type of concrete (SFX: KRAK!). It looks distinctly unpleasant.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSFX: oof!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason rolls over onto his arms, pushing himself up slightly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSFX: Ugh!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGreat. I’m in the _sewers_. I swear to God, this better not be Croc...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason, now standing, looks around appraisingly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHuh. No one here. Too dark to see any cameras… have to use the built-in flashlight...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nSame shot as before, except the air around Jason is now filling with a noxious looking green gas.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAh, _there_ we are. Not gonna lie, that _is_ a pretty good trap.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut _someone_ didn’t think _this_ part through.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Jason raises a hand to the side of his helmet, light now emitting from the eyeholes, swirls of green mist in the beams.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHuh. Helmet scanners don’t recognize this gas. New player, or an old one with new tricks? Can’t even say. Too many candidates. Half of damn Arkham could do it. Scarecrow. J--\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nSame panel as panel five, except with Jason just frozen in place.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nJason turns, looking around.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSeems pretty clear this wasn’t built for _me_ specifically. Probably _is_ the real dropoff point. Asshole up there saw a chance to get me out of his hair and took it. Not the lead I’d have _preferred_, but beggars, choosers. Bigger problem, though...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN**\nSix panels, one full-width, a row of two, and a row of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide exterior shot of the DOMINO HOTEL. Or its construction site, at least... only the foundation is in place so far, despite the sign out front proudly proclaiming \"DOMINO HOTEL: COMING SOON.\" A chain length fence, covered with tarps, runs the perimeter of the area. The sun is setting now, and the area seems to be empty in the twilight. Our view is from the perspective of a nearby PARKING GARAGE, and we can see the vague silhouettes of human figures in the foreground.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI am _not_ making the handoff tonight.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nFIGURE\nHe’s not going to show, is he?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nSwing around to show the RED HOOD GANG, or at least the 12 of them presumably picked for this mission. They’re suited up for business now, in gang colors which many of them have supplemented with red facemasks or motorcycle helmets. We see the familiar faces of Luis, Jo and Tyler in the foreground, and can see that it’s Tyler who was speaking.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nHey man, there’s still time. But probably not, no.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nGod fucking dammit.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nShot from behind, of the Hood gang members lined up in the garage, watching the hotel. Vehicle lights shine in the distance.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nWhadda we do now? Give him a few more minutes?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Luis. He’s got a hand to his chin, looking deep in thought.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nThe handoff won’t be fast. We could give him a few more --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO (OFFSCREEN)\nNo.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up of Jo. She’s staring intensely at the site.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nYou remember what he said during the Dent thing, don’t you? He’s not our fucking _babysitter_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nAnother close-up of Jo. She’s putting on a RED MOTORCYCLE HELMET.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nWe go in now.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN**\nEleven panels, a row of three and two rows of four. The panel borders start out straight, but get wobblier as the page goes on, angled haphazardly. Rather than the regular gutters, the background of this page is a green mist.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Cut back to Jason in the sewers, surrounded by that same strange gas. Through the gloom, we can see a vague human figure. Jason sees it, too, head whipped around towards it. We can only see the side of his helmet, not the back.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot alone. Here comes the welcoming committee.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nAnother medium shot. Jason’s looking around again, and right now, he appears to be surrounded, more and more figures appearing in the gloom.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nOh, no. Please. Don’t hurt me.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium action shot. Jason ducks as one of the figures, indistinct through the gloom, whips a chain towards his head.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSorry, that was unclear. What I meant was, don’t _try._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium action shot. The lines on this one are a little blurrier. Jason elbows one of his attackers in the face, as another grabs his arm.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGreat. Bad enough I’m missing the handoff, now I’m fighting in the dark, in a SEWER.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium action shot. Jason’s punching one of the assailants in the gut. The colors are shifting now, bright reds and vivid greens, with lines beginning to blur.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBad enough I’ve barely SLEPT all week. Bad enough I can’t stop thinking about DENT. Bad enough I can’t stop thinking about the fucking _PIT_. Now I have to fight in a stinking fucking --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium action shot. Jason pauses partway through punching at one of his attackers.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWait. That’s… why am I smelling…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up of the back of Jason’s helmet, where he feels along the back with one gloved hand. It’s CRACKED along the hinge, a jagged line disrupting its integrity.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOh, _fuck_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Jason’s swaying in place, figures blurring around him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThe _gas._ How long’s it been… how long I have before…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot. Jason slumps, arm held out to either side by the figures around him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNo. _No._ I won’t… it’s not…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\nClose-up on Jason as one of the assailants’ weapons connects with the side of his helmet. It’s a metallic gray blur of motion. Hard to tell what it is. Might be a pipe. Might be a crowbar.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n_No._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ELEVEN*\nJason snaps his head back up. The color scheme is now entirely in red and green, and the text and border on his internal monologue are now green, too, the font more erratic, the borders slanted.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n***NO!***\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGES TWENTY AND TWENTY-ONE**\n18 panels, as three rows of six. Two-page spread. The panels go from left to right across the entirety of both pages. They’re not standard-sized, though, but small and cramped, with lines and vivid colors that bleed out of their inks, and are arranged scattered across the background of a poisonous green gutter, not clearly either liquid or solid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nCutaway panel. Back to the Domino, wide exterior shot. A large TRUCK pulls up through the gate in the fence. A group of four unmarked black sedans are parked across from it, a group of men in suits and various False Face Society masks standing in front of it.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Two workers, also wearing False Face Society masks, open the back of the truck, two more inside unloading it.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nWide shot. The False Facers are now surrounded by the RED HOODS, all wielding guns.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nJason lunges towards one of the assailants. His posture is sloppy, his moves wild, almost animalistic.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nThe False Facers open fire on the attacking Red Hoods.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nJason pins down one of the assailants, fist back, swinging at their face repeatedly.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nA few of the False Facers get torn open by gunfire as the Red Hoods open fire, themselves.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nJason is pulled off by one of the assailants.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nOne of the Red Hoods gets torn open by gunfire, as well. Hard to say who it is, in the chaos.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\nJason flips the figure who grabbed him over his hip, sending them flying towards the ground.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ELEVEN*\nLuis and one of the False Facers grapple with each other, both trying to wrest the other’s gun from their hand.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWELVE*\nOne of the assailants’ chains wraps around Jason’s arm, pulling it backwards.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THIRTEEN*\nJo takes cover behind one of the sedans, firing around the edge of it, gunfire surrounding her.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOURTEEN*\nJason lunges at one of his assailants with his knife, drawing blood.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIFTEEN*\nLuis kneels, face pained as he grabs his stomach. Gunshot wound in the side. Not clear how bad it is.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIXTEEN*\nThe assailants, still largely indistinct but now clearly wounded, finally begin to fall back.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVENTEEN*\nThe False Facers, having taken heavy casualties, finally make a retreat, loading themselves into their vans. Notably, the truck remains where it is.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHTEEN*\nJason stands, alone, in the middle of the sewers, a gun in one hand and his knife in another, blood spattering him.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO**\nEight panels, a row of three, a row of four, and a full-width panel.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason collapses to the ground, breathing heavily (SFX: hff hff). He’s holding his helmeted head in his hands, sporting a few new cracks and dents. His internal monologue color has returned to normal, though the lines are still not quite perpendicular.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nJesus _fuck_. Was that just the...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason lifts his head back, staring upwards. The air looks clearer now.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThe gas is clearing. Must’ve finally run out.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot, Jason POV, of the sewer ground. It’s not exactly clean, but there’s no bodies scattered around.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLooks like they all booked it. No clues. Could maybe follow their tracks, I guess. Don’t know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jason stands, the motion looking very reluctant.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGot two choices. I go home and sleep this shit off, they'll know I'm coming. Have time to prepare. I follow this lead now, I might get something.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose on Jason’s helmet, with its visible cracks.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOr I might wander straight into ANOTHER trap, drugged out of my mind.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up. Jason shakes his head.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n… and leave the rest of the Hoods to fend for themselves. _Damn_ it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nCut back to the Hoods. Jo stands in the middle of the group, surveying the scene. A number of dead and wounded False Facers, and a number of dead and wounded Red Hoods. Tyler’s just lying on the ground. Luis is curled up, pressing a hand to his stomach, looking like he’s in pretty bad shape.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMight be too late already. Dunno. Probably is.

He’s dressed fancier than anyone around here, with a suit and an expensive watch, looking notably out of place.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHang on. Who’s this, now?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVEN**\nSeven panels, see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n⅔ width, medium shot. The man from the previous page looks around, adjusting a cufflink. Sneering a little bit.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nClothes say he’s got money. Watch agrees. Not a millionaire, but well off. Lawyer, maybe an accountant. What's he doing here?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n⅓ width. Medium shot of a woman at the bar who's clearly a sex worker. She eyes the new arrival appraisingly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNevermind, figured it out.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason goes back to his drink.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot my business, then.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\n⅔ width, medium shot. The businessman sits down next to the woman, and his hand is already on her leg. She looks a bit taken aback, willing to roll with it but clearly getting bad vibes from this guy.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOr it wouldn’t be, if he weren’t being a fucking asshole about it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason is visibly scowling.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI hate these fucking people. Rolling in here like we're all just set dressing. Their own personal amusement park.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason's expression darkens further.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nYou want a good time? Fine. But show some goddamn respect.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason takes a large gulp of his drink.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut she can handle herself. I need to focus.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHT**\nEleven panels, see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Jason stares across the bar.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Marty and the TNT brothers talk amongst themselves, heads together.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\n⅓ width, medium shot. The businessman is leaning way into the woman's personal space. She looks uncomfortable.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Jason stares across the bar.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\n1/6 width. Glenn and the TNT brothers chat.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\n½ width. The businessman is pulling at the woman's bra strap. She has a hand up, indicating him to back off.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason stares across the bar.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\n1/9 width. Glenn and the TNT brothers.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\n5/9 width. The businessman has his hand on the woman's stomach. She's grabbing his wrist, apparently saying something to him indignantly, but there's no dialogue.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\n⅓ width, extreme close-up of Jason's eyes. Jason stares across the bar.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ELEVEN*\n⅔ width. The businessman is grabbing the woman's arm, apparently saying something back angrily. She looks furious and alarmed, trying to jerk her arm away.\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINE**\nThree panels, see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n⅓ width. Close-up on Jason's hand as he slaps a handful of cash on the bar. Enough to cover his drink, and any damages.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n⅔ width. Over the shoulder shot, medium. The creep, still holding the woman’s arm, looks over his shoulder in surprise as Jason, only his arm visible, taps on it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n‘Scuze me.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCREEP\nHuh?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nFull width panel, medium action shot. Jason decks him.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TEN**\nNine panels. As this page progresses, the panel get smaller, and except for the last panel, blurrier and harder to follow.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n½ width, medium shot. The guy lunges back at Jason, catching him around the waist.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n½ width, medium shot. Jason and the guy, predictably, topple onto a nearby table.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Chaos begins to ensue. One of the other patrons takes a swing at Jason, which connects.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\n⅓ width, medium shot. The bartender, McSurley himself, ducks into the back room\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\n⅓ width, medium shot. It is at this point that the lines and colors begin to blur as this action sequence devolves. Multiple people are now slugging it out, with Jason in the center.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\n¼ width, wide shot. People are now clearing out of the bar and away from the brawl.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\n¼ width, medium shot. A blur of unclear action. Jason is in the midst of a brawl with the businessman and other unclear assailants.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\n¼ width. This panel is entirely black.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\n¼ width, medium shot. Jason stands alone above the now unconscious creep, fists at his side, breathing heavily. The table nearest him is broken. Some damage has been done.\n:::\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. The woman is also still here, arms folded across her chest. She seems irritated. Jason looks at her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou okay?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWOMAN\nI could have handled that myself.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up as Jason looks back at her. His expression is strangely blank.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYeah, but you didn’t have to.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up. The woman's expression does not soften.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWOMAN\nI could have handled that *without trashing the place*.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up. Jason looks moderately embarrassed, looking away.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYeah, well… yeah, okay.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason hands her a few hundreds. She looks surprised.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHere. Cover your losses.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWOMAN\nOh. I guess that makes you… Well, could've been worse, I guess.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. She leaves, speaking over her shoulder to Jason.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nWOMAN\nI’m splitting before the cops show. You’d better do the same.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYeah, I will. Thanks.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWELVE**\nFive panels, two rows of two and then a full width one.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jason looks around at the rapidly emptying bar. Marty and the TNT Brothers are nowhere to be found.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLooks like my targets have bounced, too. Not really a surprise.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason looks down at the unconscious creep, who’s dropped his wallet.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nUgh. She’s right. That was *dumb*. Million less messy ways I could’ve handled that. But I got angry, and then I got sloppy.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nStory of my life.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason looks around.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAnd now I gotta find my guys’ trail again.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on the guy's wallet, and next to it, a pair of car keys.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNo way. Is that --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nWide shot. Jason, still in civvies, is now driving a ‘56 Lincoln Continental that he has *very* clearly stolen from Creep.\n:::\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN**\nFive panels: see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFull width, medium shot. Jason frowns slightly as he looks at the wheel.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nDamn. Handling like a brick. That creep even take care of her?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Jason dials up a number on his phone while at a stoplight.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWell, don’t worry, girl. You’re in better hands now.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\n⅓ width, close-up. Jason is on the phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPHONE\n-- have reached the number 211-555-2924. Please leave a message at the tone.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHuh, guess he’s out of the shop. Weird.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nCharlie. Red here. I’m looking for parts to fix up a ‘56 Continental. Gonna swing by in the morning, so let me know if you can rustle anything up.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\n⅓ width, medium shot. Jason re-pockets his phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGotta focus now, though. Lost their trail, but I've got a Plan B.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nFull width panel, wide shot. Jason drives through the city.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMcSurley's was neutral territory, but if they've been spooked, they'll want to go somewhere familiar to finish their business. If that's one of the TNT brother's places, I'm hosed. But they're new in town. So odds are, Marty will take them to one of his places. And I've been running surveillance on that chucklefuck since I *started* this.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jason pulls his car up outside of a worn-down apartment building.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMarty’s got a pad he uses when he needs to lay low. Gut’s telling me to check there.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Mind, my gut’s gotten me killed before, but --)\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of a beaten-up junker of a car parked outside the building.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThat’s Marty’s ride’s out front. I've hit paydirt.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason gets out of the car, sliding on his helmet as he moves.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nTime for a conversation with these gentlemen.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nWide shot. Jason ascends the building’s fire escape.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Jason slides open a window, gun in hand.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up as Jason's boots contact the ground.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLet's see how sharp these --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN**\nTwo panels\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nSplash page, wide shot. Marty and the TNT brothers lie dead on the floor. On the wall behind them, smeared in what seems to be blood, are the words “LET JUSTICE BE SERVED,” and below them, a crude rendition of a gavel.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nInset panel, lower right-hand corner, close-up. Jason stares at the scene in astonishment.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWait. What?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up. Jason kneels down, touching the bodies with a gloved hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI can’t have been more than a few minutes behind these guys. Whoever did this works fast. Killer was probably waiting for them when they got in.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of the bloody words on the wall.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMotivation isn’t exactly a mystery. Looks like Gotham’s got a new vigilante. One who’s not afraid to get their hands a little dirty.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason looks around.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot, same angle as before. Jason bursts out laughing.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Jason pops the front of his hood, wiping at an eye, because yes, he is laughing *that* hard.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAmazing. Fucking **amazing**. Someone in Gotham finally wises up, and it puts a hole right in my day. What the hell do I do now?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up. Jason looks around the room again, helmet still open.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI’d *like* to just call this good. But the TNT brothers have gotta have stashed their goods away somewhere. Gavel guy planning to take care of that one? I don’t even know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Jason rifles through one of the brothers' pockets.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n‘What we’ve got here is a failure to communicate!’\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Great. That’s gonna be stuck in my head all day now.)\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up. Jason turns on one of the phones he retrieved from the guy's pockets. There's a PIN number pad.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nLocked. Of course. I'll have to try to crack it back at base.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot. Jason pockets the phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThat reminds me. Wonder if Charlie’s got back to me yet?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nEleven panels, see breakdown.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\n½ width. Close-up of Jason's own phone screen. He has 11 missed calls.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThe hell?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\n½ width, medium shot. Jason puts his phone up to his ear. A series of messages sound over his phone over the course of the next several panels, each in their own jagged-edged speech bubbles.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nPHONE\n\"\"\"dialogue\nFirst new message from: Jordan\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPHONE\nHey, boss. You should know, Andy missed his drop-off today. On my way to his place, but you said to report if he stepped out of line, so. Yeah.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSFX: BEEP\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nPHONE\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSecond new message from: Jordan.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPHONE\nBoss, you need to get over here.

We've got three missed check-ins today, and the ranks are getting pretty spooked. I know you said you're on some recon whatever today, but you gotta get down here as soon as you can.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSFX: BEEP\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nPHONE\n\"\"\"dialogue\nFourth new message from: Lin\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPHONE\nBoss, Kev is dead. Cops say it happened last night. I just heard.

It's Luis. I'm making the call to tell everyone to lay low until you get in. Something's hitting us hard and I don't like this.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSFX: BEEP\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nPHONE\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSixth new message from: Jo.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPHONE\nTAKE YOUR DAMN PHONE OFF SILENT AND GET OVER HERE.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\n⅓ width, Medium shot. Jason hangs up the phone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nJesus Christ. This can’t be Black Mask. Who hit us this bad?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\n⅓ width. Over the shoulder medium shot of Jason looking at the writing that the mystery vigilante has left.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ELEVEN*\n⅓ width. Close-up of Jason’s look of realization.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n**Oh.**\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN**\nTen panels, one full width panel and 3 rows of 3.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide interior shot of the RED HOODS HEADQUARTERS. A variety of RED HOOD GANG MEMBERS are milling around, talking amongst each other. In the center of the shot are two people. LUIS DEL TORO is a tall, gangly Latino man with short dark hair, dark eyes, a goatee and a red jacket. JO TORÁIN is a short Eurasian woman with long, bushy, dark hair, dark eyes, a black denim jacket and a red newsboy cap. They’re standing with their heads towards each other, talking.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot from behind as Luis and Jo both whip around, pointing guns.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nWow, quite a party. What’s the occasion?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jason, his helmet closed again, as he stands in front of both of them. His arms are folded and his head tilted in amusement.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nWanna step a little closer? Y’might actually hit me.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nBoss. You’re here.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYeah. I took my damn phone off silent.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot as Luis lowers his gun. He looks embarrassed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nYou know Jo didn’t mean anythin’ by--\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason waves a hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nRelax. What am I, Black Mask? We can all use our grown-up voices. Now, can someone tell me what the hell just happened?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot as Jason and Jo stand across from each other, arms folded across both their chests.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nWhat *happened*? Five of our guys are *dead*, is what happened! Where the hell were you?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nBusting up Mask's shit. See, I had this weird idea I was your boss, not your fucking babysitter. You can't take care of yourselves for three damn hours?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nSimilar to panel six, but Jo’s pointing at Jason, and Jason’s unfolded his arms, gesturing with a hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nThis wasn't normal shit.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nGreat. So tell me what it *was*.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Jo turns away, throwing up a hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nCalls started coming in about two hours ago. Near as I can tell, we lost five guys. Andy, Jordan, Kev, Leo, and Rex.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nAll today?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nNo. Three of 'em last night. We just heard about it when Luis started making the calls.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot. Jason turns his head towards Luis, who stands on Jason’s other side.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nWe sure that's all?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nHonestly, no. I called everyone I could, but everyone's layin' low. Can't blame 'em. I ain't never seen anythin' like this outside of -- well. You.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\nClose-up of Jason, who’s turned his head, apparently looking around.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHm.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN**\nSeven panels. As a nine-panel grid, but with one panel for the first row.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot, with Jason still looking around. He seems to be processing the size of the crowd for the first time. Most of them are shooting Jason curious glances.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nJesus. How many of us you cram in here?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Luis shrugs.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nI couldn't let 'em stay out there.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n'Cause it's such a better idea for everyone to cram themselves in like sitting ducks?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot as Jason addresses his gang, who look back at him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nEveryone go the hell home. Take tomorrow off and come back on Friday. I'll take care of this.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Jason's hand. He's holding a slip of paper out towards Luis and Jo.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHere. Got a new emergency line. Call me if anything urgent comes up. Don't use it unless something urgent comes up. I don't just go dark because I feel like it, y'know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason turns up the collar of his jacket, turning to leave.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nAnd Jo? Always nice to catch you in a good mood.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up as Jo snorts.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nSFX: SNRK\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nMake this fucker pay, and we'll talk good moods.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSFX: HEH\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Jason leaves.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jason in the parking lot, tossing his helmet in the back of his car.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot gonna lie… I hated these guys anyway.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason gets back in his stolen Continental.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nCan’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs. Can’t take over the Gotham Underworld without hiring some real dirtbags. And these guys were some pieces of work. They followed the rules, so I kept ‘em around. But honestly, I’d have killed ‘em myself given half a need.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason steers his car, driving.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo I’m not exactly crying to see them dead. But it is decidedly **inconvenient**.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nAnother medium shot of Jason behind the wheel.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI need to have a chat with 'Gavel' before things get out of hand. If I’m lucky, they’ll see reason. If not… well, then things get *interesting*.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n(Maybe I should just tip off Batman. Wouldn’t *that* be ironic?)\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Jason adjusts his rearview mirror, apparently thinking.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nFive of my guys, three of Mask's. Three last night, five today. Weird symmetry. Feels like I'm missing a pattern.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nCutaway/flashback shot, divided vertically, the left half a shot of Andy and Kev and the right of the TNT brothers.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAndy and Kev were brothers. Both killed last night, along with Rex. Trevor and Terry Brewer were brothers, too.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Back to Jason in the car.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThat's two sets of three, each two brothers and a third. But Jordan and Leo are only two, and neither of them had any siblings. Neither of them had anyone, really.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Jason drums his fingers on the wheel.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWell, I guess Jordan had Charlie. Recruited them together. About the only reason I gave Jordan as many chances as I did. Charlie's gonna be --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nClose-up as Jason's eyes go wide.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n**Charlie**.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE**\nFour panels: one row of three and one splash panel.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jason turns the wheel of the car sharply, drawing protesting honking from the car behind him.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide shot. Jason pulls his car outside of a chop shop intentionally reminiscent of the one from page one. There are lines for spaces, which he is not even close to following.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jason entering the door, as viewed from inside the shop. He has his domino mask on, but not his helmet.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nCharlie? Charlie?!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nSplash, wide shot. CHARLIE lies dead on the floor of his chop shop. Blood is everywhere, and sure enough, the words on the wall read \"LET JUSTICE BE SERVED\", the drawing of a gavel beneath. Jason can be seen from behind, staring at the scene.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n**No**.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO**\nFour panels.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason sags against the wall behind him, looking genuinely upset.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nDamn it. God damn it. **Why?**\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up. Jason puts a hand over his eyes.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThe other guys were fair. Pain in my ass, but I **got** it, y'know? But Charlie? Fuck, what the hell did he ever do? He was just a chop shopper. Never killed anyone, never laid a hand on anyone, never fucked with any kids. He didn't deserve this shit.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot.

He's changed the pattern, but I still see it. Three sets of three. A pair and an odd one out. The familiar hiding in the unfamiliar.

If this were actually being drawn, the reader would be forgiven for mistaking this for an actual ad… this one features a smiling Mediterranean woman with brilliant green eyes, holding up a bottle of a slightly greenish but otherwise clear liquid. A resemblance to Talia Ghul would not be out of place. She’s standing on a gorgeous Mediterranean beach, white sand and blue waters behind her, sun bright in the sky. The ad text proclaims, “PANACEA: Miracles _can_ happen.”\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (VO)\nI’m sorry, we stole _what_, now?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWO**\nSix panels, one full-width, one row of four, and one full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide interior shot of a large STOREROOM. Most of the supplies are fairly unremarkable… medical supplies, clothes, guns and knives. You know, the usual. But in the center of the room is a large crate, lid off. Its contents consist of rows upon rows of vials, filled with a clear, slightly greenish liquid. Each one has a clear label and logo: PANACEA. On either side of the crate stand JASON TODD, in his Red Hood outfit, helmet on, and JO TORÁIN, looking a little worse for the wear but largely unharmed after the events of last issue. Jason is standing with his arms folded, while Jo gestures towards the crate.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nIt’s this new drug they got out now. They say it can cure anything --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI’ve seen the ads, yes. _This_ is what you went and got everyone shot up for?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Jo, who’s immediately furious, pointing an accusing finger towards Jason.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\n_Don’t_. Don’t you _give_ me that shit. You weren’t even _there_ --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jason. His helmet covers his expression, but he’s holding up a hand, conciliatory.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nFuck. She’s _right_. _I’m_ the one who blew the deadline. Don’t know why I’m tearing _her_ head off about it.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nLook. Didn’t mean it like that. You handled it right. Just can’t believe Luis mighta gotten killed over a bunch of _snake oil_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Jo. She’s standing with her arms crossed now, face turned away, still scowling.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot of Jo. Her shoulders relax, and she sighs (SFX: hff.)\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nYeah, okay.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nBut... what if it _isn’t_? Yeah, it sounds too good to be true, but if Mask wanted it _this_ bad, there’s gotta be a reason, right? And if it works...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot of the crate. Its contents seem a little… off now. The colors are slightly distorted, blurred and haloed in different colors. If you know anything about digital coloring, it’s as if the RGB layers are just a little misaligned.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO (OFFSCREEN)\nThen this is _real_ medicine. This is good, right? Think of what we can _do_ with this. We get everyone patched up, and then --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWO**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nBack to a close-up of Jason.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nShe’s right. This couldn’t be more perfect for us. Probably about the _only_ thing we ever lifted from Mask we could sell with a _clean conscience._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason kneels by the crate, holding one of its vials up to the light. The angle is a little skewed, like the camera has tilted slightly. The art on the crate itself is distorted further, like it’s the center of a fish-eye effect.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nCan’t just give it to a hospital. Doesn’t matter that it’s perfectly good. They have to treat it like it’s tainted. So why let it go to _waste_? Keep some of it. Sell most of it, cheaper’n market prices. Play Robin Hood with the rest, spread it around to the people who _really_ need it. Everyone wins.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on the vial in Jason’s hands. Something is _clearly_ wrong now… the color distortion effect is here again, and the lines give an almost vertigo effect.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nYeah, _right_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jason pockets the vial as he stands. The art is mostly back to normal, though the angle still seems a little off.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nNo. Lock it down. No one so much as _touches_ this ‘til we can confirm it is what it says it is.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nBut --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nBut, what? Look, you did good getting this. Really, you did. But we take heavy casualties, then it turns out the score is some supposed miracle cure? This right here stinks of _bait_. Don’t know about you, but I’ve walked into enough _traps_ lately.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Jason’s helmet, expressionless.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nThis isn’t the time to get _stupid_. I don’t want _anyone_ near it until we know more. Got it?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Jo’s face, equally expressionless.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\n… got it, _Boss._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THREE**\nSeven panels. One full-width and three rows of two. The colors on this page are all slightly distorted with the same blurred color halo effect as before, and the panel borders are slanted and wobbly.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot of Jason, grappling across the Gotham skyline. Given the returned distortion of the colors here, proooobably a good thing he’s not driving.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nProbably should have stuck around. But I couldn’t hold it together much longer. Needed to get _out_ of there.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Jason’s feet as he touches down on the edge of a rooftop. The landing looks a bit sloppier than his usual, feet barely on the ledge, bits of cement crumbling underfoot.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI'm dancing on the edge here. About an inch from completely losing it. Been here before, more than a few times. Sometimes, I pull myself away. Sometimes… I don't.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nWide interior shot. We’re back in Jason’s workshop, Jason walking through the door. He tosses his helmet aside with one hand as he enters, peeling his domino mask off with the other.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jason just collapses onto his bed, still wearing his jacket and boots and everything.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Jason with his eyes closed. He’s a mess. Gaunt skin, and of course, dark circles under his eyes.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nJust… need some sleep. Some REAL sleep. Just a few hours…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nSame as panel five.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nSame shot as panel five, except now Jason has opened his eyes. They’re a bright, vivid green.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nFuck.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOUR**\nSix-panels. Three rows of two, but they’re a little too off to be called a grid. Same wobbly edges as the previous page.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot from above. Jason, having retrieved the Panacea vial out of his pocket, is holding it up to the light again.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWhat the hell _is_ this?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on the vial of Panacea. We can see Jason’s reflection in it, but it’s… wrong. Too young, face bloodied, expression wild and furious.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo damn _familiar_… keep thinking about-- No. It’s _impossible_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason tosses the vial onto his bedside table, draping his other arm over his face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nUgh. Can’t think straight. Gotta… gotta be aftereffects from that trap. Gas hasn’t worn off.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on the vial, sitting on the table. It glints green in the light.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nJust… just the gas.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nFull-body shot as Jason stands, running a hand through his hair.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nFuck. The _gas_. Never got answers on that _trap_, ‘cept that it was set by Black Mask’s _mystery_ buyer. I find them, I might find answers about this Panacea thing.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. Jason slides his hood back into place, the helmet sealing with a pneumatic hiss (SFX: Shhhhh).\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMight find _something_ to chase these _thoughts_ out of my head.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIVE**\nFive panels, one full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nHigh-angle wide shot of a small courtyard. There’s room enough for maybe a dozen people, if they really squeeze together. The entire courtyard is strangely clean, as though it’s been scrubbed down recently. We’ve been here before, last issue. In the foreground, Jason stands on the edge of a rooftop, surveilling it.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason leaps down into the courtyard. He notably has his grapnel gun in one hand… not gonna get caught the same way twice, it seems.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nDidn’t get a chance to look this place over much last night.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up. Jason crouches to look at the courtyard. We can see the faint lines of the trapdoor, but everything else seems to have been scrubbed down recently.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMight still not. Whole place has been swept clean.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jason has moved somewhat, and is now staring at the side of a building. There’s an odd patch on the wall, recently applied concrete covering the aging siding.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nButton's gone, too. Could get back into the sewers another way, but I'm sure they've cleaned that up, too. Still, not seeing a better --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nJason POV shot. Further into the alley, we can see the edge of a figure rounding the corner.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n-- hang on.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIX**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFull body shot of a teenager slinking through the alley. She looks to be in her late teens, maybe 16 or 17, and is clearly homeless, wearing dirty and torn jeans and a stained gray hoodie. She has a dingy backpack over one shoulder, which looks like it was probably for school at one point, but hasn't been cleaned in years. She’s looking nervously over her shoulder.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nThe teen looks back in front of her again, only to stop short, startler, as she nearly runs into Jason. He’s taller than her by enough that she only comes up to about his shoulder, and his head is offscreen.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot. The teen looks panicked now, backing away. Jason stands in front of her. Other than his height advantage, he appears to be doing his best _not_ to be intimidating for once, both hands raised, helmet missing, expression soft. We've never seen him like this before.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nEasy. Not gonna hurt you.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium two-shot. Jason and the teen stand across from each other. She looks over her shoulder nervously, as though considering running. Jason’s still standing there, though he’s lowered his hands.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou got a name, kid?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\n… Jen.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nJen. Good name. You looking for something in that courtyard, Jen? Maybe for _someone_?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Jen. She looks _very_ nervous and unsure.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nNot here to make trouble for you. People've been going missing there. Don't know who's taking 'em. But I'm trying to find out.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. Jen stands with her arms crossed, defensive.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\n… what's it to you?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Jason looks at her, hands in his pockets.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI was a street kid, too. We gotta look after each other. Who else is gonna?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nJen looks down, considering.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nSame shot as panel eight, but now Jen is speaking.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\nI have a friend...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVEN**\nFour panels, stacked. All panels are sepia-toned flashback panels.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jen sits on the stoop of a building next to an older teenager, also homeless, both sharing a scavenged meal.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (VO)\nHis name’s Damon. We’ve known each other for years. Take care of each other, I guess.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nExterior shot of the rear of the Masquerade Club, before its, uh, unfortunate run-in last issue. One of the bouncers stands by the door, handing a satchel to another homeless teenager, neither Jen nor Damon.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (VO)\nI’ve known for a while that the Masquerade offers -- uh, offered, I guess -- odd jobs, you know? Runners and that stuff. But, you know, half their pay’s in smack, and I never wanted to touch that stuff or anything -- \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (VO)\nSmart girl.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (VO)\nI guess.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nExterior shot of the rear of the Masquerade. The three bouncers from issue three stand around the teen from panel two, surrounding him. Their hands are raised, and while there’s no dialogue, they seem to be making quite a sales pitch to him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (VO)\nWell, maybe a month ago, we start hearing them talk about some _other_ gig. They promise food and shelter for honest work. But everyone _I_ know who’s signed up, I’ve never seen again.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (VO)\nYour friend…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nWide exterior shot of a HOMELESS CAMP, a group of tents and haphazard shelters pitched in an abandoned subway station. A FIGURE stands in the center, wearing a hooded robe and holding a crook. His arms are raised as though preaching.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (VO)\nNeither of us bought it. Sounded too good to be true. But about a week ago… someone came to our camp. Weird guy. Robes and hood, carrying this staff like he’s got a bad back or something. He’s promising the same thing… food and shelter for good work. But this time, he’s talking about some _leader_ who can cure _anything._ I didn’t buy it, not for a second. But Damon… he’s… he’s living on borrowed time, you know? \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (VO)\nYeah. I do.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (VO)\nDamn it. I told him not to go.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHT**\nEight panels, two rows of three and a row of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nBack to the present, a medium two-shot of Jason and Jen.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nSo they’ve been kidnapping people. Luring them in with promises of food, shelter and medicine?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\nNot just that. There's this kinda… religious thing about it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Jason, head tilted and eyebrows raised.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nReligious?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on Jen, looking down.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\nYeah. They say the leader's some miracle worker. That he's been blessed by God himself, and that’s how he can… you know, heal and stuff. Creeped the hell out of me.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on the strap of Jen’s backpack. There’s a button on it, worn but lovingly cared for, with the stripes of the trans flag on it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (OFFSCREEN)\nHaven't... exactly had good experiences with zealots.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nYeah. I get that.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nAnother medium shot of Jen and Jason. His arms are folded now, and he’s leaning against the wall.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYour friend… what did he look like?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\nUh… tall, like you. White, short hair… blond. Cheap eyebrow piercing. Uh...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nFlashback panel to last issue. Page 21, panel 6, specifically. Don’t look it up, I’ll recap it here: it’s a medium action shot, Jason pinning down one of the assailants who’d attacked him, fist back, swinging at their face repeatedly. The panel is blurred, colors smearing outside of their lines, details lost, but two things are clear on the pinned figure: short blond hair and a long, green raincoat.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (VO)\nGot a really nice green raincoat he usually wears, got a few years on it but it’s still in pretty good shape --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up on Jason’s shocked expression.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN (VO)\nWhat? What is it?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nJason looks down and to the right,\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n… nothing.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINE**\nSeven panels, a row of three and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Jason, having pushed himself off the wall, turns away from Jen slightly. Closing himself off. Jen seems confused.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nLook. I’ve got reason to believe he’s alive. But you stay away from all this, all right? Let me handle this.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\nBut --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nI’ll find him. I promise. But it's not safe.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up. Jason offers a few bills towards Jen. Looks like a few Benjamins in there.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nHere. Get yourself some of those hot meals you been hearing about.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jen, hesitating.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jen takes the money.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\nYou swear?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nI swear.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJEN\nAll right.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason watches as Jen leaves.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nFlashback panel. Jason, back in the trap from the previous issue, is being besieged by multiple indeterminate figures, surrounded from all sides in a confused mess of lines and colors.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Back in the present, Jason punches the wall, hard.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n_Fuck._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE  TEN**\nSeven panels, one full-width and two rows of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up shot of the PANACEA SHIPMENT. We saw it earlier this issue, but this time, the distortion effect is absent, the shipping crate just looking… normal. Lid slightly ajar, revealing vials of a slightly green clear liquid lined up neatly inside.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nEverything’s falling apart.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER (VO)\nWhaddaya mean, no one touches it?!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nInterior wide shot. We’re back in the storeroom from page two, only this time, the two figures are Jo and TYLER JEFFERSON. They’re standing across from each other, Jo’s arms crossed, Tyler gesticulating wildly towards the crate.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nAll that shit we went through, and we're just gonna _leave_ it?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nOrders from the top. You know how it is.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Tyler, pointing at Jo. He looks pissed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nDon't gimme that \"chain of command\" bull. We got wounded here, and a box of medicine in the back? That should be two and fucking two.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Jo, staring levelly back, arms crossed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nYeah, it _should_ be. But boss doesn't trust it. He says he wants to make sure it's _real_ first.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Tyler, eyes narrowed. Assessing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nSo what do _you_ think?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Jo stares back evenly, not backing down.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nI think he's got a point. We go around shooting everyone up, and it turns out Mask set us up with bad medicine, we got a whole lot more problems than a few bulletholes.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Tyler, chin tilted back slightly, challenging.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nAnd what about Luis? Huh?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up of Jo, looking down now. Her confident posture has slipped, and there’s concern on her face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\n… docs say he's still got a chance.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Tyler’s standing with his back to Jo now, arms thrown up again. Jo, meanwhile, has regained her bluster, shoulders squared.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nBull. This is bull. He's one of us. You and him are the seconds, and even _he_ doesn't get --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nStand the hell down, Ty! I don't like it either, but I'm not gonna risk _one of us_ until we know that stuff in there works!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nYeah, well…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Tyler, turning back towards Jo. His eyes dart to the side, looking at her without making eye contact.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\n… what if someone _did_ know?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Jo, suspicion all over her face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\n… what _exactly_ are you saying, Ty?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot. Tyler’s facing Jo again now, a hand to the back of his neck. Jo, meanwhile, looks even more pissed, drawing herself up to every inch of her 5’4” frame.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nLook. You know my Granma's sick, right?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nYeah. And I know you sure as _hell_ couldn't afford some new miracle drug with all the debts you got, so you better not be telling me what I think you're telling me.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nIt was just a dose. No one even missed it --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jo throws up her hands, to the point of exasperation now.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nWow. Okay. So you're just up and admitting you _stole_ from us?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up of Tyler. His expression is hard, and he’s angry again.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nDon't. Don't give me that shit. We fought and bled and _died_ for that crate in there. We all get a cut, that's the deal. I just took mine a bit early. You can't tell me that's _wrong_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot of Jo. Her arms are still crossed, but she’s looking down now, unsure again.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\n... does it…?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up of Tyler, staring.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nTYLER\nIt works. Works like you wouldn't _believe_. Everything just as advertised. It's a goddamn miracle.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot of Jo, staring into space. Thinking.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot. Jo grabs the lid of the crate.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\n… fuck it. That's enough confirmation for _me_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWELVE**\nEight panels, a row of two and two rows of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason’s back in his living space now, sitting on his bed, mask and helmet off, no jacket. He’s leaning backwards, head against the wall.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBrain’s putting together a sequence of events here. And it is _not_ pretty.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nCutaway panel. A HOODED FIGURE stands, crook in hand, on a platform, preaching to a crowd below. Everyone is silhouetted, and the background is a dark green.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nMystery buyer starts a few months ago. He makes a deal with Black Mask and starts paying him to send over people no one’ll miss. Promises food and shelter. Then once he gets ‘em, he brainwashes ‘em somehow. Gets them under his thumb, then sends them out to bring back _more_. Starts building himself up as some chosen one. Then Panacea rolls onto the scene, and now he can put _miracle healer_ on his resume. Now _everyone_ wants a piece of that. Shepherd gets more lambs for the slaughter.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nBack to Jason, head tilted back, staring at the ceiling in thought.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo damn familiar. Hatter, maybe? But that doesn’t seem right. Not with the religious angle. And that gas I got hit with tells me their preferred method of _persuasion_ is pharmaceutical.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nExtreme close-up of Jason’s eyes. The irises are still very green. _Very_ visible dark circles right now.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nReminds me of… no. Gotta be a coincidence. It’s _impossible_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. Jason leans forward, head in his hands.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nFuck. Wish I could remember more of that fight. Help confirm some suspicions. But all I’ve got is… flashes. So out of it from the… the gas...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Jason looks up slightly, staring forward.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nChrist. Who the _hell_ am I kidding?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up on Jason’s face. Eyes intense.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n_It wasn’t the gas._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFlashback panel to Jason in the sewers. Blurred colors, brawling against indistinct assailants. Familiar by now.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThat shit they pumped me with, it was just supposed to put me _down_. Losing it like I did? That wasn’t the gas. That was the _Pit._\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThe Pit...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Jason sits, staring at the vial of Panacea in his hands now.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo much that’s too _familiar._ So much that’s _impossible..._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up. Jason POV shot of the vial, blurred and distorted.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot, colors starting to blur again. Jason pops off the top of the vial.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThis is a bad idea. Even I know that right now. But I need to _know._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Silhouetted, red on green. Jason brings the vial up to his lips.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on the vial, still with most of its contents, falling to the ground. Triple image, RGB layers, with the green in the center.\n:::\n\n**PAGES FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN**\nTwo-page spread. This page doesn’t have panels in the traditional sense. Rather, this page constitutes a disjointed, assorted collection of images, all swirling within the vivid, poisonous green waters of the Lazarus Pit. Overlayed over this page in red is the outline, no fill, of Jason’s face, age indeterminate, screaming. Psychedelic colors. Colored lines, not inks. Vivid red and green color scheme. Abstract layout. Basically, go full '80s Vertigo on this shit.\n\nWithin the swirling waters, the following images stand out:\n\n* An image of the Joker, grinning, crowbar raised, surrounded by blood. The image is warped, red, the smile and the crowbar out of perspective and looming over the image.\n* A dead robin. As in, the actual bird, lying in the sand, dessicated and covered in ants.\n* Batman, viewed from a low angle. He’s taller than he should be, looming and distorted, his eyes and mouth dark pits.\n* Jason as Robin, swinging through the air. Bright and laughing and magic. Also, very dead.\n* A woman in a warehouse, wearing tan shorts and a white shirt, turned away from the viewer, smoking. It’s Talia al Ghul.\n* The bright red of a digital display. It reads 00:01.\n* Jason lying on an autopsy table, fresh cuts across his chest, eyes wide open. The shadowy figure of a doctor stands over him.\n* Jason, as Robin, pins a second figure, hands wrapped around his throat. The shot is very reminiscent of a similar panel from Batman 411, except, of course, that rather than Two-Face, the other figure is Jason as the Red Hood, half of his helmet broken to expose his face.\n* A pair of hands, wrists showing the cuffs of a suit, clawing at the lid of a coffin, fingers bloody.\n* The Red Hood gang scattered across the ground, all dead. Gunshot wounds. Red Hood stands over them, helmet on, holding a smoking gun.\n* Catherine Todd, lying dead and wide-eyed on the ground, a syringe still in her arm.\n* The finale of Under the Red Hood, Jason holding a gun to the Joker while Batman stands there, except that here, Jason is Robin, and Bruce is shooting Jason right in the face.\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nAn indistinct blur of colors, too out-of-focus to identify what it is.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Jason’s face, sideways as he lies on the ground. His eyes have snapped open. Still distinctly green, but bluer than they were.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHoly. _Shit._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason sits up, one hand on his throat.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThroat's raw. Was I screaming? Glad I soundproofed this place.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHow long was I…?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of the beside clock. It’s an analog display, showing the time as 6:50.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n_Two hours?_ Shit. LOT worse than I expected.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jason’s just still sitting on his floor, knees to his chest, one hand to the side of his head.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nCan’t be the dosage. Barely even took any. Might’ve interacted with what's already in my system. Might just be the MEMORIES. Doesn’t matter. I still know what it _is_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Jason’s face, expression intense.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nIt's Goddamn _Lazarus water._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nSplash page.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFull-page ad. Specifically, it’s the Panacea ad from page one, except defaced. The text has been blurred and melted nearly beyond legibility, but looks to be in Arabic now. If you could make it out and translate it, it would translate to something like \"You chose the wrong person to trust.\" The smiling woman’s hair is blonde now, her skin paler, and her eyes have shifted, no longer just green, but glowing green lights in dark pits of eyes, her mouth stretched in a rictus grin as she holds up a bottle of venemously green liquid. The beach behind her has become a desert, stretching into the distance, a burned-out warehouse behind her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nYou ever wonder if you were better off dead?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot “if you’d be.” If you _were_. Because once you're dead, you're not supposed to _come back_.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut I did.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nThanks to Talia. Thanks to the _Lazarus Pit._\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGuess I should be glad for the second chance. Got an opportunity to set things right. Finish what _Bruce_ wouldn't. But am I _grateful_ that I came back?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNo. I'm not. Because I _didn't_. There’s a _piece_ of me still in the grave. And there’s a piece of the Pit in _me_. One I'll never be rid of it. Not as long as the Joker lives.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo if you’d given me a choice… use the Pit, or _stay_ dead? I don't know what I'd have chosen.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAnd now…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason’s, uh, still sitting on the floor, phone up to his ear.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI don’t know what to _choose_.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nPick up, pick up, pick up…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of the phone in Jason’s hand.

She’s not answering. Don’t know what the _hell_ is happening with her and Ra’s right now, but she’s gotta know something about _this_.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nShe’s gotta know what to _do_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Jason leans his head back, staring up at the ceiling, arms resting on his knees.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBecause _I_ have no idea what the hell I’m doing here. I got thrown in once, that doesn’t make me some _expert_. But I know enough to tell you that this, this thing right here, this is _bad_. Whole world’s going to be killing each other for a _dose_ of this pretty soon here, and they don’t even know what it _costs_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up. Jason covers his eyes with a hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nFuck. I can’t deal with this. I’ve barely slept in two days and I just swallowed a _new_ psychotic break. I need to talk to someone about this.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on the phone in Jason's hand, dangling.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nAnd I am sure as _hell_ not calling _Bruce_. Bet he's already on the case. Great. Good for him. I don't want to fucking _talk_ to him. He doesn't know _shit_. _None_ of them do.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. Jason holds the phone in front of him again, dialing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo _pick up_ the _Goddamn phone_, Talia.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN**\nFive panels, two rows of two and one full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason sits with his arms on his knees again, phone dangling from a hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPHONE\n-- sorry, but the number you called could not be --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nYeah. Okay.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Jason, staring forward. He just looks… done.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo I’m getting the idea Talia’s not available right now. Which means it’s time for me to _get it the fuck together._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up. Jason pinches the bridge of his nose, thinking.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGotta get back to base. Move the Panacea somewhere more private. I can figure out what to _do_ with it later, but right now, it's a time bomb. Don't have long before people get desperate enough to try to lift some --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Jason's look of realization.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot as Jason lurches to his feet.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nFuck.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nSix panels, a row of two, one full-length, and a row of three. Panel two is twice the length of panel one.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jason rooftop hopping, bright red silhouette on a dark green background.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSometimes, when you're in the field, things go wrong. Maybe not as wrong as last night, but not great, either.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide exterior shot of a low building, single story, locked behind a chain link fence in one of the worse parts of town.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWhich leads to some problems. You show up at a hospital with a gut full of lead, the doctors start asking some _questions_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nInterior of a small CLINIC, over the shoulder from Jason, who is walking rapidly through a hallway. The closest visual reference I can give you is Leslie Thompkin's clinic, lined with low beds, but it is most definitely not, multiple armed Hoods standing around. One of them is Jo, talking to a woman who appears to be wearing a doctor's coat.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSo we got a place with a few doctors on payroll. Not exactly Harvard Medicine here, but they patch everyone up okay.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBut if I'm right about this…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot, over the shoulder from Jason as he slaps a hand on Jo's shoulder.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nWhat the --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nDid you do it?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot of Jason and, now facing Jason, Jo, Jason with a hand on either of her shoulders, shaking her. He's got his mask, but no helmet, and he looks _pissed._ Jo has definitely been caught in the act here, expression guilty.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n***Did you bring it here --?***\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nI --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nWide shot. Jason and Jo both glance in alarm at a room in the back as SCREAMING (SFX: AAAAAAA!) comes through the closed door.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nYou fucking _idiots_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE**\nSix panels, one short and full-width, one tall and full-width, and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide interior shot, outside the door. From the outside, Jason approaches, Jo on his heels. From inside, a doctor and two nurses flee the scene, apparently not being paid enough for this. At least one of the nurses is themselves wounded, face and body covered in thin scalpel lacerations.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nJason POV, wide interior shot, inside the room. It's been totally wrecked, blood spattered over the floor, chair toppled and broken, medical supplies scattered haphazardly. In the center of the shot stands LUIS DEL TORO, and not like we've seen him before. He's shirtless, blood smearing his chest but no sign of any injuries, and his expression is wild, mouth opens he screams, eyes mad and a bright, bright green.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot, Jason and Jo reaction shots. Jo is horrified, staring. Jason just looks… done.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium two-shot. Jason shoves Jo back out the door.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nOut.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJO\nBut --!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\n***Out.***\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up as Jason closes the door behind him (SFX: klk)\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nWide shot.

I know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGES TWENTY-TWO AND TWENTY-THREE**\nTwo-page spread, eighteen panels as three rows of six. This entire page is done in a silhouetted style, red figures against a green background, with one exception. The panel sizes and borders are irregular, with unevenly sized gutters.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nThe figure of Luis barrels headlong towards that of Jason, grabbing him around the waist.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nAt first, this looks like a continuation of the shot from panel one, but something seems wrong about it. The first figure, positioned where Jason was, seems even taller now, and though it's hard to tell, possibly bald. It's UBU. The second figure, FIGURE TWO, meanwhile, is shorter, gangly and scrawny. A teenager. And he's wearing a suit. It's JASON. And Ubu is holding his ground, stance wide as he tries to hold Jason in place.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nPresent Jason throws Luis over his hip, the latter man landing on the floor.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nPast Jason leaps back up towards Ubu, both hands out, feral and wild.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPAST JASON\n_AAAAAA!_\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nPresent Jason interrupts Luis's leap with a kick to his chest, sending him flying backwards.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nPast Jason grabs a knife from Ubu's belt. The blade is long and wavy.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nPresent Jason dodges backwards, barely avoiding a slash by Luis, the other man wielding a long, wavy blade.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nUbu grabs Past Jason by either wrist, forcing him to drop the weapon.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nLuis headbutts Present Jason, head crashing into his nose.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\nPast Jason leaps atop of Ubu's chest, clawing at him with both hands.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ELEVEN*\nPresent Jason drives the heel of his hand under Luis's chin, forcing him backwards.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWELVE*\nPast Jason swings at Ubu, who blocks.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THIRTEEN*\nLuis rushes towards Present Jason, both hands out.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOURTEEN*\nUbu brings both fists down on the top of Past Jason's head, sending him staggering.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIFTEEN*\nLuis collapses to the ground, hands and knees.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIXTEEN*\nPresent Jason presses a gun to the other figure's forehead. Rather than Luis, however, it's PAST JASON.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nVOICE (OFFSCREEN)\nEnough.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVENTEEN*\nWe see a figure of a woman, tall and resplendent, arms spread, wearing a flowing dress.

Black and white and red, nothing in focus enough to identify.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nCome into focus on the figure of JASON TODD, sitting on the floor of a wrecked makeshift hospital room. His arms are on his knees, and he has his mask, but no helmet. He stares into the camera, looking absolutely exhausted.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON\nWelcome back.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Luis sits up with a start. His eyes are brown again, if a bit… muddy. There's a tray to his right.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nWhat the --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nTo your right.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nLUIS\nWhat are you --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJASON (OFFSCREEN)\nTo your right.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot.

Worst two months of my life.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-FIVE**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot.

His eyes are wide and horrified.

Just outside an idyllic little town-- BLUE VALLEY.  On a sign that reads “WELCOME TO BLUE VALLEY HOME TO THE JSA’S STARGIRL”.\n\nCAP: From the Book of Solomon Grundy, book one, verse one:\n\nPanel two: We focus on Blue Valley’s Main Street now, with a specific focus on the KID FLASH museum.  Little shops line the street with names like POP’S CANDY and SOUP EMPORIUM.\n\nCAP: He began his first life to a family of greed and spite.  And so, Cyrus Gold grew to love the sins of man.\n\nPanel three: Angle on the STARBRAND CAFE.\n\nCAP: His love of sin fueled his triumph.  Ultimately, though, like all mortals, he was destined to fall, to die.\n\nPanel four: On Blue Valley High, bathing in the moonlight.  The sign outside says “WELCOME TO BLUE VALLEY HIGH/ GO SOLDIERS!”\n\nCAP: But Gold’s devotion to the purity of sin saved him.  Damned to an eternity in the Slaughter Swamp, after seven days Gold emerged, reborn as Solomon Grundy, the immortal future of humankind.\n\nPanel five: On a house with a big yard and an American Flag waving in the air.  The WHITMORE/DUGAN house.  We see a glowing speck lower herself towards the house.  It’s none other than our heroine STARGIRL.\n\nCAP: We give to our lord on Earth, Solomon Grundy.  We give to the most sinister of crimes, as they are the only way to truly expunge our souls and admit to our truest, darkest nature.  We give to the Earth, as in our time we shall find ourselves embedded there, until we return immortal.\n\nCAP 2: Born on a Monday.  Christened on a Tuesday.  Married on a Wednesday.  Took ill on Thursday.  Grew worse on Friday.  Died on Saturday.  Buried on Sunday.  Born on Monday.  That is the truth of Solomon Grundy.\n\nPage two: Five panels.\n\nPanel one: We’re on the back porch of the house now.  Stargirl lands softly, arms still aloft, hair flowing behind her.\n\nPanel two: On the other side of the screen door.  Star pushes it open and pokes her head in.\n\nPanel three: Stargirl slowly enters into the kitchen, tip toeing.  \n\nPanel four: Same angle as before. The light clicks on and Star freezes.\n\nSFX: click\n\nStargirl (small): $#^%\n\nPanel five: Same shot as before.\n\nMom OP: Courtney…\n\nPage three: Six panels\n\nPanel one: Close on Star.  She clenches her teeth (naturally, she still has her braces on) and tries to pull her glance away.\n\nStargirl: Uh… hi, Mom.\n\nPanel two: On Barbara Whitmore otherwise known as MOM.  She’s dressed in pajamas, leaning against the doorframe to the living room.\n\nMom: It’s almost midnight, you know.\n\nPanel three: On Stargirl and Mom.\n\nStargirl: I… uh… yeah.  I know.\n\nMom: And you were supposed to be home…\n\nStargirl (2): ...at nine.\n\nMom (2): And twelve comes after nine, right?\n\nPanel four: On Stargirl, half defending, half straight up pleading.\n\nStargirl: We were busy.  Kobra was holding up the UN with stolen Thanagarian technology they had bought off of Intergang.  Jay and Alan went--\n\nPanel five: On Mom, nearly fuming.  \n\nMom: You’ve got the first day of your senior year in seven hours, and I’m not going to have you sleeping through it.  We agreed that if Stargirl’s life got in the way of Courtney Whitmore’s, then you would--\n\nPanel six: Star storms past her, hands in the air in defeat.  Mom’s face doesn’t lighten in the slightest.\n\nStargirl: God! I was saving the world, not partying with friends or whatever!\n\nPage four: Four panels\n\nPanel one: Focus on Star as she marches up the stairs.  On the opposite side of the banister is Mom, trying not to shout.\n\nMom: Watch your tone!  Just because--\n\nPanel two: Stargirl spins around to face Mom, looking down from the stairs.\n\nStargirl: What?  Just because I just helped saved the country, I still get stuck with a stupid curfew?\n\nMom: I’m trying to help you, Courtney!\n\nPanel three: On Stargirl.  She marches up the stairs.\n\nStargirl: Well you’re doing a wonderful job of it!\n\nPanel four: On Mom.  She looks down, a tear nearly welling in her eye.\nMom: <sigh>\n\nPage five: Five panels.\n\nPanel one: Establishing shot of Blue Valley High School\n\nCourtney (from school): And then she grounded me!  I mean, come on!  I’m practically an adult already!  I’ve fought Black Adam, Lex Luthor, freaking Darkseid, and she’s still trying to treat me like a kid!\n\nPanel two: High school hallway.  Students hurry down, carrying books and opening lockers.  Courtney and MARY stand by Courtney’s open locker (inside there’s different Newspaper clipping featuring Stargirl.  They include “JSA Stops Hostage Crisis!” and “Stargirl Opens Up About Atom Smasher” among others.)\n\nCourtney: I mean… gah!\n\nMary: Parents suck sometimes.\n\nCourtney (2): That’s what I’m saying!  Like, doesn’t she get it?  I’m doing something important and she just, like, blows it off like it’s nothing!\n\nMary (2): Tell me about it…\n\nPanel three: On Mary.\n\nMary: The other night Josh brought me home and my blouse was a little wrinkled and my dad went ballistic!  Like, geez, the seat belt got caught up a little.  We weren’t doing anything!  I mean, we were, we were doing a lot, but that was waaaaay earlier!\n\nPanel four: On Mary and Courtney.  Mary kind of tilts her head and Courtney shrugs as she closes her locker.\n\nMary: Maybe those aren’t as similar as I thought.\n\nCourtney: Eh.  Close enough.\n\nSFX: SLAM!\n\nPanel five: Courtney and Mary begin to walk away.\n\nMary: So do you think you’ll be able to come over after school?\n\nCourtney: I don’t know.  I promised Cyclone I would fly out to Massachusetts to help her move into her new apartment, but Mom’s put me on the “no fly” list for the rest of the--\n\nFrom the crowd: Um… Star… I mean Courtney!\n\nPage six: Seven panels.\n\nPanel one: Courtney turns around to face EMMA CARTMILL (14), a scrawny girl with dirty blonde hair, hiding in a baggy hoodie and behind several heavy books, the most prominent being MEN OF STEEL BY LOIS LANE.\n\nEmma: Uh… hi.\n\nCourtney: Uh… hi!\n\nPanel two: Close on Emma.\n\nEmma: I’m… I’m Emma.  I’m… sorry for being, like, weird, or whatever, but… would you mind if I got... \n\nEmma (2)(small): (God this is so embarrassing)\n\nEmma (3): your… autograph?\n\nPanel three: On Courtney, a little confused.  Even still, she keeps a smile on her face.\n\nCourtney: Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Do you, uh, have a pen or something.\n\nPanel four: Emma struggles around her books to grab a pen from a pouch that rests precariously in her arms.\n\nEmma: Oh, yeah, sure.  Lemme just--\n\nPanel five: The books crash to the floor by Emma’s feet.\n\nEmma: Oh--!\nPanel six: Emma bends down to grab everything.\n\nEmma: I’m so sorry.\n\nEmma (small): stupid stupid stupid stupid.\n\nPanel seven: Courtney bends down to help.  She grabs the Men of Steel book from the floor.\n\nCourtney: Don’t worry about it.  \n\nPage seven: Eight panels\n\nPanel one: Over Emma’s shoulder.  We see Courtney look at the Men of Steel book.\n\nEmma: You… you really don’t have to--\n\nCourtney: Lois Lane’s new book, huh?  You know, I could probably get this autographed for you if you want.\n\nPanel two: On Emma, shocked.\n\nEmma: I… uh… huh?\n\nPanel three: Courtney and Emma stand up.\n\nCourtney: Yeah.  Lois interviewed me a couple of weeks ago for the Planet.  I’m sure she won’t mind.  Next time I fly out--\n\nEmma: I don’t… I don’t know what to say!  Thank you thank you thank you thank you--\n\nCourtney (2): Remember to breathe.  There’s commas between words, you know.\n\nPanel four: Emma turns away reluctantly as the bell rings.\n\nSFX: BRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIING\n\nEmma: Oh, shoot!  I… I should go.  Um, I… thank you so much.\n\nPanel five: Courtney waves as Emma runs off.\nCourtney: No problem!  I’ll get this back to you as soon as possible Emma.\n\nPanel six: Courtney and Mary turn to walk away, as Emma disappears into the background.\n\nEmma (small): Stargirl knows my name Stargirl knows my name Stargirl knows my name…\n\nMary: I honestly don’t know how you can stand it.  \n\nPanel seven: Still walking, Courtney shrugs.\n\nCourtney: It’s part of the job, I guess.  And, I mean, we live in a small town in Nebraska.  There’s not a whole lot to get excited about in the first place.  So when a C-List superhero like me shows up--\n\nMary: Please, you are so beyond the C-List.\n\nCourtney (2): Maybe.\n\nMary (2): Maybe?  C-List is for losers like Plastic Man and Booster Gold.\n\nPanel eight: Courtney and Mary turn the corner.\n\nCourtney: Plas and Booster are just as much heroes as I am.\n\nMary: Did you just call them “Plas” and “Booster”?  Do you, like, actually know them?\n\nCourtney (2): They were at the JSA/JLA Thanksgiving dinner last year.\n\nPage eight: Four panels.\n\nPanel one: In a science room.  Courtney opens the door, with Mary close behind.  The teacher-- a balding middle aged guy-- MISTER ADELMAN, stares dead eyed at them.\n\nCourtney: They might seem kinda goofy at first, but once you get to know them--\n\nMister Aldelman: Well, it looks like the school’s celebrity superhero finally decided to grace us with her presence. \n\nPanel two: On Courtney.\n\nCourtney: Sorry, Mister Aldelman.  We were just--\n\nPanel three: On Aldelman, fuming.  \n\nMister Adelman: You were late, Miss Whitmore.  You might think you’re some big shot superhero, but you’re also still a student here.  And that means when the bell rings, you’re expected to be in your seat.  \n\nPanel four: On Courtney and Mary.  Their shoulders slump.\n\nMister Adelman: You’re both seniors now.  So you should very well know what this means…\n\nCourtney and Mary (small): Detention.\n\nPage nine: Three panels.\n\nPanel one: An establishing shot on a grungy old storage unit.  Two men, one dressed as a construction worker and the other as a mailman, walk up.\n\nConstruction Worker: Not sure I like comin’ out in the middle of the day like this.\n\nMailman: We got nothin’ to worry about.\n\nPanel two: Closer on the two men.\n\nMailman: Our faith will protect us.  Just like the book says.\n\nConstruction Worker: I dunno, man.  Do you really believe all of this?\n\nPanel three: The mailman steps up to the door and raps his knuckles on the metal surface.  The construction worker is close behind him.\n\nMailman: ‘Course I do.  I always said there had to be an easier way of livin’.  Now we get to do whatever we want, an’ we can do it for eternity?  What’s easier than that?\n\nConstruction Worker: But some of these guys are, like, murderers.  I found this place because I cheated on my wife!\n\nMailman (2): And adultery’s a sin, ain’t it.  We’re all equal in sin, brother.\n\nPage ten: Five panels\n\nPanel one: The door opens.  A man in a gray cloak stands on the other side.\n\nConstruction Worker: Uh, yeah.  I guess.\n\nCloaked Man: Come, brothers.\n\nPanel two: We follow the Construction Worker and the Mailman through the door, and we see a sea of others dressed in the same gray robes.  They stand in a circle, radiating from a shrine with a rusty old gramophone on top.\n\nCloaked Man: Welcome.\n\nGramophone (elec.): Born on a Monday, Christened on a Tuesday, Married on a Wednesday…\n\nPanel three: The Construction Worker and Mailman grab robes and put them on.\n\nGramophone (OP) (elec.): Took ill on a Thursday, grew worse on a Friday.\n\nConstruction Worker: God…\n\nCloaked Man: Yes indeed...\n\nPanel four: At the other end of the room, the crowd begins to part, and a figure walks through.\n\nGramophone (OP): Died on a Saturday, buried on a Sunday.\n\nPanel five: Closer on the figure.  It’s none other than SOLOMON GRUNDY, dressed in ragged black robes like some sort of demented priest.  He smiles as he sees his disciples, his teeth yellow rotting.\n\nCloaked Man CAP: God.\n\nGramophone (OP) (elec.): Born on a Monday.\n\nPage eleven: Three panels.\n\nPanel one: Grundy stands with the shrine.\n\nGrundy: Welcome disciples.  You have traveled far to join me in this town, and I am grateful for that.  For today begins a new era.  For so long, my mind has been addled by ignorance.  But upon my latest resurrection, I found something I had been searching for all along.\n\nPanel two: On Grundy.\n\nGrundy: I found peace.  I found God.\n\nPanel three: Pull out to see more of the crowd, as well as Grundy.\n\nGrundy: I saw the beyond, and realized that I have escaped it and instead found life eternal.  Through infinite realities that align with the heavens, I survived.  I thrived, like no others ever had.\n\nPage twelve: Four panels\n\nPanel one: Pull out even further so that we really get the full scope of the followers.\n\nGrundy: When I awoke for my prolonged slumber once again, I found myself interred at a facility not far from here.  The people working there told me they were members of Intergang.  In one of my… less than lucid times, I remember having some acquaintance with them, although I was hardly in any state of mind to know what they were doing.\n\nPanel two: On the Mailman, fully entranced by the words of Grundy.\n\nGrundy (OP): Before I gained my freedom once again, I learned of an old religion of sorts that Intergang used to follow.  The Bible of Crime it was called, and it prophesied that crime and sin are the truest notions of a man or woman’s heart.  And that’s when I realized…\n\nPanel three: Close on Grundy.  He gives the smile of a used car salesman.\n\nGrundy: …maybe that’s why I am the way I am.  Sin is what saved me, what granted me true immortality.  I had seen God, I had seen the beyond, and upon my meeting with the Bible of Crime… I had an epiphany.\n\nPanel four: Close on the construction worker.  He looks worried.\n\nGrundy (OP): I am the one true savior.  The next step in humanity.  I am eternal, and I shall save you all.  Submit your hearts to their wildest desires, their deepest and darkest secrets.  Bathe in the joys of murder and thievery.  I have called you all here today for just this reason.  Today, we begin anew.  Today…\n\nPage thirteen: One panel.\n\nPanel one: Aerial shot of the crowd.  Grundy stands in the middle, arms in the air emphatically.\n\nGrundy (LARGE):... we shall raze Blue Valley to the ground!\n\nPage fourteen: Four panels.\n\nPanel one: Outside Blue Valley High.  Courtney and Mary burst through the doors, basking in the sunlight.\n\nMary: Oh the sun!  I never thought I’d see you again!\n\nCourtney: Detention was thirty minutes.\n\nMary (2): Really?  It felt like an eternity!\n\nCourtney (2): I’ve spent a literal eternity in a realm made of shadows and nightmares.  That was nothing.\n\nMary (3): Still sucked, though. Right?\n\nCourtney (3):...Yeah.\n\nPanel two: Shot from behind Mary and Courtney. They look out into the parking lot to see PAT DUGAN sitting in a cherry red convertible.\n\nMary: And this is gonna suck more.\n\nCourtney:...Yeah.\n\nPanel three: Closer on Pat.  He waves Courtney over.\n\nPanel four: As they step onto the sidewalk, Mary turns the other way while Courtney keeps walking towards Pat and the “camera”.\n\nMary: Well, this is my cue to leave. Remember the shadow nightmares!\n\nCourtney (small): thanks.\n\nPage fifteen: Five panels.\n\nPanel one: Courtney slides into a seat in the convertible next to Pat.\n\nPat: So… \n\nCourtney: Yeah, yeah.  I know.\n\nPanel two: Courtney slumps into her seat while Pat looks at her.\n\nPat: I know you won’t want to talk about it…\n\nCourtney: Got that right.\n\nPat (2): But… a detention on your first day back?  And after the argument you had with your mom last night…\n\nPanel three: On Courtney, about ready to explode.\n\nCourtney: I was late to one class because I was helping a freshman!  It’s not my fault Mister Aldelman is such a--\n\nPanel four: On Pat as he tries to remain calm.\n\nPat: Courtney, I know this is a hard time for you, but--\n\nPanel five: Courtney tosses her head back in exasperation.\n\nCourtney: Not another one of these talks!  “Things seem hard but they’ll get better” and “it’s all just a normal part of growing up.”  But you know what, Pat?  It’s not a normal part of growing up!  I’m a superhero!  I shouldn’t have to take crap from people like Aldelman or--\n\nPage sixteen: Six panels\n\nPanel one: On Pat and Courtney.\n\nPat: Superhero or not, you’ve got responsibilities here.  High school is an important stepping stone--\n\nCourtney: To what?  College?  Pat, I don’t… I’ve got other things to do!  And I mean, sure, I’ll go to college, get a job and all that, but shouldn’t Stargirl come first?  Shouldn’t saving lives and kicking butt come first.  That’s what’ll matter in the end, right?\n\nPanel two: On Pat.\n\nPat: Court… let’s go home and talk it over with your mom.\n\nPanel three: Courtney crosses her arms.\n\nPanel four: On Pat.  A flash of sympathy crosses his face.\n\nPat: Courtney… \n\nPanel five: On Courtney.\n\nCourtney: Yeah.  Fine.  Let’s--\n\nPanel six: Pull out.  Courtney and Pat look as a plume of smoke and fire billows into the sky, over a few blocks of houses.\n\nCourtney: On second thought… any chance the staff is in the trunk.\n\nPat: Always is.\n\nPage seventeen: Four panels\n\nPanel one: Transition.  Outside the Kid Flash Museum now.  People stream out in fear as smoke spills from the second floor.  The walls are beaten and battered, and the front doors have been blown clean off.  Stargirl enters the scene from the sky.\n\nStargirl: You sure STRIPE is away for good, Pat.\n\nPat (OP) (elec.): I’ll stick to quarterbacking, Court.\n\nStargirl (2): Just checking.  ‘Cause anything that could do this much damage…\n\nPanel two: In the museum.  Stargirl lands and enters through the door, stepping over rubble.\n\nStargirl: ...could probably use a couple of punches from a giant robot.\n\nPanel three: Standing on top of a few overturned displays is the mailman from earlier, dressed in the same gray robes, a giant sci-fi Apokoliptian bazooka in his hands.\n\nMailman: Burn!  Burn!\n\nPanel four: Stargirl flies in and kicks the mailman square in the jaw, knocking him over.\n\nStargirl: Burn?  That’s all you’ve got?  And here I was trying to think of a witty one-liner to open with.\n\nPage eighteen: Five panels.\n\nPanel one: On Stargirl, in a fighting stance, her staff lit up.\n\nStargirl: But if you’re not even going to try…\n\nPanel two: On the mailman as he staggers up, a somewhat concerned look on his face.\n\nMailman: A superhero?\n\nPanel three: The mailman smiles and fires the bazooka.  Red-orange energy blasts out.\n\nMailman: How cool is that?\n\nSFX: BOOOOOOOOOM\n\nPanel four: Stargirl is hit with the blast and is knocked backwards.\n\nPanel five: Stargirl knocks into a statue of Kid Flash, who stands arms akimbo, a smile on his face.  The statue crumbles.\n\nSFX: CRASH!\n\nPage nineteen: Six panels\n\nPanel one: Stargirl lies in the rubble, the statue’s head pointed in her direction.\n\nStargirl: What’re you lookin’ at?\n\nPanel two: Thinking he’s triumphant, the mailman stands in the middle of the room, waving the bazooka around.\n\nMailman: YES!  All the heretics and infidels shall burn and be denied their spot in eternity!\n\nPanel three: Stargirl FLIES in, WHACKING the Mailman across the face with her staff.\n\nStargirl: See, now that’s what I’m talking about.\n\nPanel four: Stargirl punches the Mailman.\n\nStargirl: A little pizazz in your villainous monologue.\n\nPanel five: Stargirl blasts the Mailman down.\n\nStargirl: A little moxie.\n\nPanel six: Stargirl stands over the stunned Mailman triumphantly.\nStargirl: Not bad for your first fight, I’ll admit.  Now, you wanna tell me what you were doing here?  Other than mindlessly destroying the place, that is?\n\nPage twenty: Five panels.\n\nPanel one: On Stargirl, finger to her ear as she speaks into her communicator.  She’s a little confused.\n\nPat (OP) (elec.): Court.  You finished in there?\n\nStargirl: Yeah.  The guy didn’t put up much of a fight.  Just blew some stuff up and talked about “heretics” and “infidels”.  Pretty standard--\n\nPat (2) (OP) (elec.): Good.\n\nMailman (OP): Heh.\n\nPanel two: Stargirl looks down at the mailman and points her staff at him.\n\nPat (OP) (elec.): Because Blue Valley just took a left turn into hell!\n\nMailman (LARGE): HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!\n\nStargirl: What’s so funny?\n\nPanel three: Closer on the Mailman.\n\nMailman: We shall embrace the carnage and the chaos.  We shall be empowered by the hate as this insipid little town turns to nothing but cinder and ash.\n\nPanel four: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: What the hell are you talking about?\n\nPanel five: We’re elsewhere now. Establishing shot of a suburban house as the sun just begins to set.\n\nMailman CAP: “Died on a Sunday.  Born on a Monday.”\nPage twenty-one: Six panels\n\nPanel one: In Emma Cartmill’s room.  Posters of superheroes plaster the walls, including Flash, Superman, Wonder Woman, Zatanna and of course, Stargirl.  Comics are scattered on the floor, and we see a messy desk with papers strewn across it.  The wall mounted TV displays news footage of the JSA defeating Kobra.  Emma lays on her bed, feet in the air, chin held up by her hands as she watches the TV.\n\nSFX: KNOCK KNOCK\n\nMrs. Cartmill (OP): Emma, can you get that!  It’s probably your father!\n\nEmma: Can’t Teddy get it?\n\nMrs. Cartmill (2)(OP): He says he’s busy with homework!\n\nPanel two: Emma drags herself off her bed and makes her way to her door.\n\nEmma: Fine.\n\nPanel three: Emma rushes down the stairs.\n\nSFX: KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\n\nEmma: I’m coming!\n\nPanel four: Emma swings the door open.  We don’t see who’s on the other side.\n\nEmma: Oh, hi Dad.\n\nPanel five: We reveal that on the other side of the door is the Construction Worker, dressed in gray robes.  He looks worried.\n\nEmma: Why’re you dressed like that? \n\nConstruction Worker: Uh… is your mom in there?\n\nPanel six: Close on Emma.\nEmma: Yeah.  She’s making dinner.  It’s spaghetti and meatballs tonight.  Why?\n\nConstruction Worker (OP): Because…\n\nPage twenty one: One panel\n\nPanel one: The Construction Worker steps to the side to reveal Solomon Grundy standing behind him.  Grundy smiles an evil smile.  Emma staggers back, terrified.\n\nConstruction Worker: ...I need her to meet someone from work.\n\nGrundy: Good evening.\n\nCREDITS AND TITLE\n\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n","date":"2020-04-01T04:00:00.000Z","_id":"815bdc10b45045d7b844743d280b9c82"},{"title":"The Cult of Solomon Grundy Part II: Blue Valley on Fire","number":"2","series":"e48ab4914f2e46a7a58fb2c1fb1ac303","author":"9ccaefa51e9b4d89ab2871aedc1b899f","editor":"e449b288a0e443cb9d40aed630df523d","content":"Stargirl #2\n“The Cult of Solomon Grundy Chapter Two: Blue Valley on Fire”\n\nPage one: Four “wide-screen” panels.\n\nPanel one: Tight on a plate of SPAGHETTI with a fork wrapping itself in noodles.

All hell is breaking loose out here!\n\nStargirl CAP: I guess it doesn’t really matter how it happened, though, does it?\n\nPanel four: An aerial shot of Blue Valley’s Main Street as a riot breaks out.  Windows are broken, buildings are on fire and in the center of it all are men and women in GRAY ROBES.\n\nStargirl CAP: All that matters is now, *I’ve* got to fix it.  \n\nPanel five: On Stargirl.  She closes her eyes to find her resolve.\n\nStargirl CAP: Think, Courtney. Think.  \n\nStargirl CAP 2: There’s no time to call in the JSA.  Hopefully they’ll see this on the news and get here soon, but for right now, it’s up to me.\n\nPanel six: Stargirl flies down.\n\nStargirl CAP: Gotta get to the civilians, first, just like Jay always says.\n\nPanel seven: Stargirl lands among the chaos, near a couple running from falling rubble.\n\nStargirl: Over here!  Hurry!\n\nPage five: Five panels\n\nPanel one: As the couple runs past Stargirl, hiding behind her for safety, Stargirl sees crumbling debris falling towards an elderly man.\n\nStargirl CAP: Now… risk assessment, just like Alan tries to teach.  I leave these two alone for too long, and they could get into more trouble.  But if I don’t save that old man…\n\nPanel two: Stargirl hurls herself at the old man, flying him out of the way just in time.\n\nStargirl CAP: Aw, who am I kidding.  He’s the one in the most imminent danger.  Just gotta act fast…\n\nPanel three: Stargirl lands with the old man.  The old man looks out of breath and surprised.\n\nStargirl: It’s okay, now.  How are you feeling?\n\nOld Man: Happy I finally invested in some adult diapers.\n\nStargirl (2): Uh… try to find somewhere safe while I deal with these bozos.\n\nPanel four: The old man rushes off as Stargirl turns to face the mob.\n\nOld Man: Don’t have to tell me twice.\n\nStargirl CAP: Now it’s time for… what does Ted call this part?\n\nPanel five: Tight on Stargirl smiling.\n\nStargirl: Oh, yeah.

A FEMALE ANCHOR is on screen, holding up her notes and looking concerned.\n\nFemale Anchor (elec.): ...Department urges families to stay in their homes.  They would like us to ensure our audience that they are working hard to ensure the safety of everyone right now.\n\nPanel two: Angle on two-and-a-half year old PATRICIA DUGAN, standing at the coffee table, flailing a KID FLASH action figure through the air happily as the TV keeps playing.\n\nFemale Anchor (elec.)(OP): While there are still no signs of the Justice League or even Kid Flash, Stargirl has reportedly been sighted at the scene.\n\nPatricia: BAH!  Bah bah gah!\n\nPanel three: PAT DUGAN enters and scoops Patricia up.  She smiles.  He does not.  He yells to Barbara and Mike, who are somewhere off panel.\n\nPatricia: Ha ha!

Flying down distracted these yahoos enough to give the civilians a chance to get the heck outta Dodge.  Now it’s time to take a page out of their book, I guess.\n\nPanel three: Angle up to see Stargirl lift into the sky.  She gives a sarcastic little wave.  Robed goons crowd around the “camera” looking up in anger.\n\nStargirl: Sorry, boys and girls!  Go back to your mommies and daddies for now.  There will be another show after a quick half hour break!\n\nPage eight: Five panels\n\nPanel one: Angle on Stargirl’s hand as she holds a JSA communicator.\n\nStargirl CAP: Damn!  It’s not picking up a signal!\n\nPanel two: Stargirl lands on top of one of the nearby buildings, rubbing her fingers through her hair.\n\nStargirl CAP: Okay, just… just take a breath.  You’ve handled threats before, Courtney.  This… this can’t be too bad, right?  You… you took out that one paintball guy, remember?  He was… I mean, he was a loser, but you weren’t so great yourself back then.  And then there was that time you handled Grundy when Joker went all…\n\nPanel three: Close on Stargirl.  She stops in her tracks, a look of worry on her face.\n\nStargirl CAP: Wait.  That… that guy at the museum.  \n\nPanel four: Same angle as before.  Stargirl’s face transitions into one of horror.  \n\nStargirl CAP: “Died on a Sunday.  Born on a Monday.”  It’s him… Grundy’s behind all of this.\n\nPanel five: Stargirl overlooks the wreckage of the town.\n\nStargirl CAP: I don’t know how he’s back, but he is.  Last I heard, he was dead.  But then again, that’s kind of his thing, isn’t it?\n\nPage nine: Seven panels.\n\nPanel one: On the cover of the book Men of Steel by Lois Lane.  It’s held in big gray hands…\n\nStargirl CAP: I don’t know how I’ll do it, but I need to find him.  I need to end this.\n\nPanel two: Same angle.  The big gray hands open the book and flip through the pages.\n\nGrundy: Ah, Ms. Lois Lane.  I have to admit, I was never a big fan of her reporting, but her prose?  Simply beautiful.\n\nPanel three: Pull out so that we see the rest of the dining room.  The family still sits around the table nervously with half eaten dinners in front of them.  Grundy’s wearing a makeshift napkin bib tucked into his robes.  He points the book over at Emma.\n\nGrundy: I presume this is yours, young lady?  My disciples did find it in your room.\n\nPanel four: On Emma.  She nods nervously.\n\nEmma: I… yeah.  Yeah, it’s… it’s mine.\n\nPanel five: On Grundy.  He smiles a creepy smile.\n\nGrundy: A voracious reader.  Almost… quaint, in this day and age, really.  It’s too bad we have to kill you.\n\nPanel six: On the Construction Worker.  He stands from the table, a sudden, momentary wave of courage rushing over him.  It surprises even him.\n\nConstruction Worker: But… sire, you… you didn’t say…\n\nPanel seven: On Grundy, pleased with himself.\n\nGrundy: Exactly, brother!  I didn’t say anything.  I was just looking for a meal.  And now that my hunger has been sated, it is time for my blood lust to be as well.\n\nPage ten: Six panels\n\nPanel one: On the Construction Worker, his confidence fading fast.\n\nConstruction Worker: But… please.  They… they’re my--\n\nPanel two: On Grundy.  He rolls his eyes.\n\nGrundy: Oh… don’t make me add you to the list, too.  \n\nPanel three: On the Construction Worker, now with an added dose of befuddlement on top of his terror.\n\nConstruction Worker: The… the list.\n\nPanel four: On Grundy.  He shrugs.\n\nGrundy: Well, when one has a religion based around the act of murder, it helps to have some organization to it.  Especially when said religion is a vehicle for world domination.\n\nPanel five: On the Construction Worker.\n\nConstruction Worker: I didn’t really… I mean…\n\nPanel six: Grundy tilts his head and looks at the Construction Worker.\nGrundy: Go on.  We seek sin to discover the truth, brother.  So speak your truth.  Do you wish to forsake your sworn brotherhood and join the feckless masses of infidels that shall burn during our holy crusade?\n\nPage eleven: Four panels.\n\nPanel one: Tight on  the Construction Worker, nervous.\n\nConstruction Worker: I… uh… no.\n\nPanel two: On Emma.  She looks like she’s just been punched in the gut.  How could her father betray her like this?\n\nGrundy (OP): Good.  Good.\n\nPanel three: Grundy closes the book and looks back at the family.\n\nGrundy: Well, that was a lovely dinner.\n\nPanel four: With a wave of his hand, three robed men enter, each holding some sci-fi looking gun.\n\nGrundy: Unfortunately, there are other things I must tend to this evening.  The Awakening has hardly just begun.\n\nPage twelve: Three panels\n\nPanel one: Angle on Grundy as he walks out the door.\n\nGrundy: Kill them.\n\nPanel two: On the Construction Worker.  He rushes to Grundy.  Grundy doesn’t even stop to notice him.\n\nConstruction Worker: But wait!  I… I’m loyal.  I’m loyal to the--\n\nPanel three: On Grundy as he walks out onto the porch.  The sun is just beginning to set.  He smiles.  We see the front window as it glows with an ominous red light.\n\nGrundy: How quick you’ve forgotten the sin that took Judas and Brutus to the deepest most layer of Hell.\n\nSFX: BLAAAAM!\n\nPage thirteen: Six panels\n\nPanel one: We’re in the BLUE VALLEY CREDIT BUREAU.  The details don’t really matter all that much because the whole place is basically on FIRE.  Stargirl kicks a robes man square in the jaw.\n\nStargirl CAP: I don’t even know how long it’s been at this point.  Could be hours, could be minutes.  \n\nPanel two: Stargirl whips around to whack another man in the stomach with her staff.\n\nStargirl CAP: I know I’ve fought a lot of these jerkwads, though, that’s for sure.  Half of their crimes don’t even make any sense!  These two must’ve confused a credit bureau for a bank.\n\nPanel three: Stargirl leans against her staff, dog tired, breathing a heavy sigh of relief.\n\nStargirl CAP: They’re all *super* inexperienced, so that makes it all a little bit easier, but still, they’ve got super hi-tech weapons from God-knows-where, and there’s enough of them to… fill a zoo?\n\nPanel four: Stargirl points her staff at one of the floored men, who is desperately trying to crawl away. \n\nStargirl CAP: I don’t know.  I’m tired.  My analogy game isn’t exactly on point right now.\n\nStargirl: Talk.  About your boss, more specifically.\n\nRobed Man: I… I shall never betray the--\n\nPanel five: On Stargirl.  She rolls her eyes.\n\nStargirl: All right, cut the crap!  You @#$%factories have been running around and lighting my hometown on fire, which, being a superhero and all, doesn’t make me super happy.  Luckily, no one has been seriously hurt, because then I might be inclined to go all Batman on your @$$ and drop you off a building.  And I guess if that’s where you want to take this--\n\nPanel six: On the Robed Man.  He holds his hands up in surrender.\n\nRobed Man: Fine, fine.  I’m not even super into this.  I just stole a kumquat from a Wal-Mart and got talked into this by one of my buddies.  \n\nPage fourteen: Four panels\n\nPanel one: On Stargirl, confused.\n\nStargirl: Wow.  \n\nPanel two: Same angle.  Stargirl cocks her head to the side.\n\nStargirl: That’s it?  I mean… you all seemed like amateurs, but there were a few… actual criminals out there.\n\nPanel three: On the Robed Man.\n\nRobed Man: I’m… I’m not like them, okay?  Some of them… yeah, they’re psychos, but… I don’t know, this just kinda seemed like fun.\n\nPanel four: Pull out to see Stargirl pressing her staff against the Robed Man’s chest.\n\nStargirl: Well, I don’t have nearly enough time to go over how messed up *that* was, so I’m just gonna ask…\n\nPage fifteen: One panel\n\nPanel one: On Stargirl.  She grits her teeth, her face lit up from her staff.\n\nStargirl: ...where is Solomon Grundy?\n\nPage sixteen: Five panels\n\nPanel one: In PAT’S GARAGE.  We don’t see much of it yet, just an angle over Pat’s shoulder as he watches his computer screen.  General scenes of havoc play out.\nPanel two: On Pat.  He hangs his head.\n\nPat: <sigh>\n\nPanel three: Barbara (or MOM) puts her hand on Pat’s shoulder.  \n\nMom: She… she’s gonna be okay, right?\n\nPat: I…\n\nPanel four: Close on a somber Pat.\n\nPat: I can’t get through to her.  Something’s blocking the comms…\n\nPanel five: Behind Pat and Mom and they huddle together.\n\nPat: I don’t… I don’t know, Barb.  I don’t know.\n\nMom: God… I… I shouldn’t have been so harsh with her, earlier.  I shouldn’t have--\n\nPage seventeen: Five panels\n\nPanel one: Close on Pat and Mom.\n\nPat: You can’t think about that, Barb.  You can’t… all we can worry about right now is us.  \n\nPanel two: Pat turns around and looks at MIKE (who’s about fourteen) as he sits in the middle of the room with Patricia, as he entertains and plays with her.  We’re also getting our first good look at the rest of the garage.  The walls are covered with spare robot parts and previous iterations of the S.T.R.I.P.E. suit.  The red convertible from last issue is also parked by a workbench.\n\nPat: We’re safe in here.  As much as I want to help Courtney… there’s nothing we can do for right now.  So we stay here until the whole thing blows over and--\n\nPanel three: On Mom.\n\nMom: This isn’t the kind of thing that just “blows over”, Pat!  Blue Valley’s practically turned into a warzone!  And… and Courtney is right in the middle of it.  \n\nPanel four: Pat hugs Mom.\n\nPat: Courtney knows what she’s doing.  She got a good head on her shoulders, and let’s face it, she’s saved the world more than a couple of times.  Whatever’s happening up there… she can handle.  She’s a real hero now.  So let's just sit tight… \n\nPanel five: We’re outside now.  Angle on a mailbox that reads DUGAN-WHITMORE.  It’s fairly calm.  The unrest from Main Street hasn’t quite hit the cul-du-sacs yet. \n\nPat CAP: “...and stay safe.”\n\nPage eighteen: Three “widescreen” panels.\n\nPanel one: Three shadowy figures walk by the mailbox.\n\nPanel two: Angle on the figures as they approach the front door. \n\nPanel three: In the light of the moon, we see that the figures are wearing the now signature gray robes of the cult.  The man in front, apparently the leader, bares his teeth as his jaw pokes out from underneath the hood.  He smiles and licks his chops like some kind of deranged tiger.  He brandishes a long, curved knife.\n\nRobed Leader: In his name, we commit these sins…\n\nPage nineteen: Two panels\n\nPanel one: On Stargirl as she zooms through the sky.\n\nStargirl CAP: Don’t know if I can really trust that idiot, but it’s the best lead I’ve got.  And Carter always says to follow whatever you’ve got.  \n\nStargirl CAP 2: And, I mean, he’s a few thousand years old or something, so he knows what he’s talking about.  \n\nPanel two: Stargirl stops in mid-air and looks down.\n\nStargirl CAP: What a shock.  The guy actually knew what he was talking about.\n\nPage twenty: One panel.\n\nPanel one: On Grundy, standing in the middle of the street.  He smiles, looking up as Stargirl, backed by the moon like a spotlight, hovers down.\n\nStargirl CAP: Now… it’s time to finish this.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","date":"2020-05-06T04:00:00.000Z","_id":"20a17bb4f3844ad1828eda271209e277"},{"title":"The Cult of Solomon Grundy Part III: Divine Evil ","number":"3","series":"e48ab4914f2e46a7a58fb2c1fb1ac303","author":"9ccaefa51e9b4d89ab2871aedc1b899f","editor":"e449b288a0e443cb9d40aed630df523d","content":"Stargirl #3\nThe Cult of Solomon Grundy Part 3: Divine Evil\n\nPage one: One panel\n\nPanel one: It would be a peaceful night in the idlystic little cul-de-sac if it weren’t for the hulking zombie dressed like some sort of demented reverend.  As the sun is setting, STARGIRL lands on the ground, teeth gritted, facing SOLOMON GRUNDY.  Grundy smiles, arms open.\n\nStargirl CAP: The air smells like death and freshly cut grass.  With each movement, his flesh seems to shift a little, almost like it could fall off at any second.\n\nStargirl CAP 2: But at the same time, his muscles bulge, his eyes narrow in and his smile of yellow, rotten teeth widens.  He’s been waiting for this.\n\nStargirl CAP 3: Somehow, he managed to get a cult following-- literally-- and convinced them that evil was the way to their salvation.  They came to Blue Valley, my home, to attack and spread their word.\n\nStargirl CAP 4: It’s not a coincidence.  It’s *can’t* be.\n\nStargirl CAP 5: Years ago, Grundy killed my predecessor, Slyvester Pemberton.  Now he’s looking for the sequel.\n\nStargirl CAP 6: Well, that ain’t gonna happen.\n\nGrundy (singing): There’s a Stargirl waiting in the sky…\n\nTITLE AND CREDITS\n\nPage two: Six panels.\n\nPanel one: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: Oh, shut up.\n\nPanel two: On Grundy.\n\nGrundy: Ah.  It seems I have struck a nerve.\n\nPanel three: On Stargirl, angry.\n\nStargirl: Yeah.  You come to my hometown, you let a bunch of psychos loose on the streets, you try to kill me and everyone who lives here, you could say I’m a little pissed off!\n\nPanel four: Grundy straightens his collar.\n\nGrundy: Yes.  Anger.  Feel it surging through you.  It is good.  It is natural.  Hate and rage are the emotions of nature.  They ensure our survival, keep us strong and focused.  They are purifying.\n\nPanel five: On Stargirl.  Her staff lights up.\n\nStargirl: Cut the crap.  You can go ahead and talk about how holy you are or whatever, but let’s face it: it’s just an excuse to be a monster.  \n\nPanel six: On Grundy.\n\nGrundy: To quote scripture--\n\nPages three and four: One panel stretching from one side of the page to the other, and going down about half way.  Five other panels below it for a total of six.\n\nPanel one: Pull out so they’re both in frame.  Stargirl shoots a solid stream of energy from her staff.  It hits Grundy and his rockets backwards across the street.\n\nStargirl: You can take your scripture and shove it up your @$$!\n\nStaff (SFX): \n\nGrundy (LARGE): Oof!\n\nPanel two: Grundy slams into a tree on the other side of the street.  It cracks.\n\nGrundy: Guh!\n\nSFX: WHAM!\n\nTree (SFX): crack\n\nPanel three: Grundy hangs his head and wipes a trail of gray-green blood from his lips.  He smiles.\n\nGrundy: Heh.\n\nPanel four: Grundy stands, a massive hole now burned through his shirt, revealing the gray skin underneath.  The skin has started to tear away around the rib cage, and we can see a couple bones.\n\nGrundy: You know, I’ve always regretted how Pemberton’s death happened.  \n\nPanel five: Grundy straightens himself out.\n\nGrundy: I was… manipulated.  Really, it was Bones’ hand that did it.*\n\n*Note: This happened *way* back in Infinity Inc. #51-53. -SOUP! \n\nPanel six: Close on Grundy, smiling.\n\nGrundy: I would have preferred to have ripped his spine from his back.  To have ground his bones to dust and to have ripped his skin off like wrapping paper on Christmas morning.\n\nPage five: Three panels\n\nPanel one: Grundy charges at Stargirl.\n\nGrundy: Of course, it looks like I have another chance today.\n\nPanel two: Stargirl springs over Grundy, rolling through midair as Grundy continues on recklessly.\n\nStargirl: Not so fast, Reverend Freakazoid!\n\nStargirl CAP: Thank *God* for all those years of gymnastics.  And the good old Cosmic Converter Belt, too.\n\nPanel three: Stargirl lands all superheroy, staff held out at her side as it glows.  She grits her teeth in determination.\n\nStargirl CAP: After all, there’s no *way* I can take this brute in a hand to hand fight.  I need to be quicker, outmaneuver him.\n\nPage six: Five panels\n\nPanel one: On Grundy, from behind.  He looks over his shoulder, a light of pure evil flickers in his eyes.\n\nStargirl CAP: And then I’ll only have a fifty/fifty chance of being torn in half like a wishbone.\n\nPanel two: Grundy slams his fist into the ground where Stargirl was standing.  Bits of road spew up as Stars just narrowly leaps out of the way.\n\nStargirl CAP: Oh joy, oh happy day.\n\nPanel three: In midair, Stargirl arches around, swinging her staff like a baseball bat, a trail of cosmic energy following it.  \n\nStargirl CAP: I feel like I should be quipping right about now.  But honestly...\n\nPanel four: Stargirl lets loose, whipping the energy that’s been building up on her staff.\n\nStargirl: YAH!\n\nStargirl CAP: I’m just not in the mood.\n\nPanel five: The energy slices through Grundy’s back, and he falters forward.\n\nGrundy: Guh!\n\nPage seven: Three panels\n\nPanel one: We’re in the Dugan-Whitmore house now, just inside the front door.  The door bursts open as it is kicked down.\n\nSFX: CRACK!\n\nPanel two: Three robed men enter, making their way through the front hall. We see a picture of the Dugan-Whitmores hanging on the wall, huddled together at the beach.\n\nPanel three: Close on the picture, the shadowed visage of one of the men reflected in the glass.\n\nHooded Man: Looks like we’ve got the right place.\n\nPage eight: Four panels\n\nPanel one: Angle on the massive computer screen in the garage.  It reads “INTRUDER ALERT”.\n\nSFX: Veet!  Veet!  Veet!\n\nPanel two: Angle on PAT and BARBARA (or MOM).  He walks over to a large cabinet at the wall.\n\nBarbara: Pat…\n\nPat: I know this isn’t ideal, Barb.\n\nPanel three:  Close on Pat.  He grabs the handles of the cabinet.\n\nPat: But right now…\n\nPanel four: The cabinet doors swing open revealing the S.T.R.I.P.E. suit.  It towers over Pat as he looks up, almost prideful of his work.  \n\nPat: It looks like S.T.R.I.P.E. might have to come out of retirement for a moment.\n\nPage nine: Five panels.\n\nPanel one: S.T.R.I.P.E.’s chest plate opens up, revealing a small armory of similar looking weapons.\n\nSFX: VRRRR-WOOSH\n\nPanel two: Pat takes a very sci-fi looking blaster from a holster.\n\nPat: I’m going up.  Be careful.\n\nPanel three: Pat steps away solemnly.  Barbara hangs her head and MIKE steps up.\n\nMike: C’mon, Dad.  Let me come, too.  I can grab another one of those blaster things and--\n\nPanel four: On Pat as he takes his first steps up the stairs.\n\nPat: Mike, I need you to stay down here with Barbara and your sister.\n\nMike: But Dad, I can help--\n\nPat (2): You are helping, Mike.  You’ve got your job…\n\nPanel five: Tight on Pat as he walks up the stairs.\n\nPat: ...and I’ve got mine.\n\nPage ten: Six panels\n\nPanel one: Close on Stargirl, hunched over, lip bleeding, hair forming a tangled frame around her face.  It’s been a while since we last saw her, and she’s been through HELL.\n\nStargirl CAP: God, I’ve lost track of time.\n\nPanel two: Grundy emerges from a massive plume of smoke.\n\nStargirl CAP: Every time I hit him, he just shrugs it off.  \n\nPanel three: On Grundy.  His shirt’s been torn away completely, and his gray skin is ripped in spots, revealing either rotten sinew or bone.\n\nGrundy: You still fail to understand.\n\nStargirl CAP: I… I got him away from that cul-de-sac.  Tried to get him away from civilians.  \n\nPanel four: Pull out, revealing that we’re back on Main Street.  Windows have been smashed, some buildings are still on fire, and walls everywhere are marked with spray paint reading phrases like “Praise Grundy” “He is Eternal” “# Sixseasonsandamovie” “Paintball Lives!” and “Freedom!”\n\nGrundy: You think some quest for good makes you invincible.  You’ve been so firmly brainwashed into actually believing that “the good guys always win”.\n\nPanel five: On Grundy.\n\nGrundy: You think you can defeat me in battle and then you will win.  But in seventy, eighty years time, you will be nothing more than a worm’s buffet six feet underground, while I will continue to survive, thrive even, on my evil intent.  For I am pure and perfect and have been granted eternity for my wrong doings.\n\nPanel six: Stargirl leans on her staff.\n\nGrundy (OP): Tell me?  Does that really sound like a victory for you?\n\nStargirl CAP: My vision’s getting blurred.  My mouth tastes like blood.  Why won’t this bastard just stay down already?\n\nPage eleven: One panel.\n\nPanel one: Grundy rushes at Stargirl and before she can even wince, he back hands her into the air.\n\nStargirl: AHHH!\n\nGrundy: Why won’t you learn?\n\nSFX: BAM!\n\nPage twelve: Seven panels.\n\nPanel one: Grundy’s massive hand grabs onto Stargirl’s ankle before she goes too far.\n\nPanel two: Grundy SLAMS Stargirl into the pavement.  Asphalt spews upwards.\n\nStargirl: Gah!\n\nStargirl CAP: If it weren’t for the cosmic converter belt and the staff, I’d be dead right now.\n\nPanel three: Grundy picks Stargirl up by the throat and sneers at her.  Her costume is ripped, her mask is torn to  reveal a black eye.\n\nGrundy: You think you can save this world?  Such a petty obsession for one so powerful.\n\nStargirl CAP: Honestly, I’m not sure how I feel about my chances *with* them.\n\nPanel four: Close on Grundy.\n\nGrundy: Submit to your most evil intentions, and you can finally be pure.  Isn’t that what you want?\n\nPanel five: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl CAP: His grip tightens.  I’m going to die here.  \n\nStargirl: Nnh…\n\nPanel six: Grundy slams Stargirl into the ground again.  More chunks of pavement fly up.\n\nStargirl CAP: Oh, god, I’m going to die here.  \n\nGrundy: Submit to the evil in your heart!  Submit to the anger that flows freely in your veins!  Submit to who you really are!\n\nPanel seven: Upwards angle on Grundy, arms to his sides, almost like he’s flexing.\n\nGrundy: It is as simple as human nature!  The only difference between me and you is the willingness to admit to that!  To embrace that!\n\nPage Thirteen: Four panels\n\nPanel one: Back at the Dugan-Whitmore house.  Pat sticks to the shadows, blaster held close to his face.  He peers around the corner to see the cloaked men in the living room.\n\nTV (OP)(elec.): ...founder of the Justice Society of America, also known as the Flash, has confirmed that all attempts to make contact with Stargirl have been in vain.\n\nPanel two: In the living room, one of the robed men kneels down to inspect the Kid Flash action figure left last issue.\n\nJay (on TV)(OP)(elec.): Everything has happened so quickly that we haven’t been able to mobilize yet.  Without making contact with Stars… we’re pretty much going in blind.  We’ve made hasty actions before and they’ve come back to bite us.  We’re trying to avoid that this time.\n\nPanel three: Angle on the KF figure as the man picks it up.\n\nJay (on TV)(OP)(elec.): But a teammate is in there, and you have my word, we will be going in to help her as soon as we can.\n\nPanel four: The robed man snaps around when he hears something behind him.\n\nSFX: BEEEWM!\n\nRobed man: The hell?\n\nJay (On TV)(OP)(elec.): If you’re hearing this, Stars, we’re on our way.\n\nPage fourteen: Six panels\n\nPanel one: Angle over the robed man’s shoulder.  We see Pat holding his blaster, standing over the unconscious bodies of the other two men, faint smoke pluming above their chests.  Pat stands tense, ready to attack.  But he’s tired, and he’s not sure how much he can really do.\n\nPat: The blaster’s non-lethal, but it sure packs one helluva wallop.  So I’ll give you one chance to get the @#$% out of my house before things get ugly.\n\nPanel two: The robed man reaches into his robes.\n\nRobed Man: For evil!\n\nPanel three: Same angle as previous.  The robed man pulls out a pistol and points it at Pat (along with the “camera”).\n\nRobed Man: For Grundy!\n\nPanel four: Out of nowhere, a laser blast hits the robed man in the shoulder, sending him tumbling down.  Pat looks on in shock.\n\nRobed Man: GUH!\n\nPanel five: Pan over to see Mike, holding up one of S.T.R.I.P.E.’s arms, detached from the body.  The fingers are smoking.\n\nMike: Booyah!\n\nPat: Mike!\n\nPanel six: Pat walks over to Mike as the younger Dugan lowers the robot arm.\n\nPat: I told you to stay in the garage!\n\nMike: See, I was gonna do that, but then I saw this arm just hanging there and figured, you know what, since you’re retired…\n\nPage fifteen: Two panels.\n\nPanel one: Mike stands arms akimbo (thus awkwardly balancing the arm) as he looks off into the distance. \n\nMike: …*I’ll* be the new S.T.R.I.P.E.!\n\nPanel two: On Pat.  He face palms in exhaustion.\n\nPat: Oh boy…\n\nPage sixteen: Four panels.\n\nPanel one: We’re inside a florist’s shop.  Stargirl crashes through the window, shattering both the glass and a vase full of roses.\n\nSFX: SMASH!\n\nStargirl CAP: My brain grows foggier as I try to quip, try to make Grundy think that I’m at least a little confident.\n\nPanel two: On Stargirl, laying on a few now dead flowers.  \n\nStargirl CAP: Oh, who am I kidding?  He’s dead, not an idiot.\n\nPanel three: Grundy steps through the broken window.\n\nGrundy: Oh, come now.  It feels like you’re not even trying at this point.\n\nPanel four: Weary, Stargirl stands, depending mostly on her staff.\n\nStargirl: Well… I’m not… done yet.\n\nStargirl CAP: Mister Terrific has always said that I’m not using my staff’s full power.  Apparently, Ted Knight designed it to be more dangerous, if needed.\n\nPage seventeen: Five panels.\n\nPanel one: Stargirl blasts Grundy in the shoulder.  The behemoth falters back.\n\nStargirl CAP: I’ve honestly been afraid of what I could do with it.  As good of a man as Ted Knight was, he wasn’t always the most stable.\n\nPanel two: Stargirl rushes into the air.\n\nStargirl CAP: I’m not sure what he put the upper limit as.  I’m not sure he *did* put an upper limit.  \n\nPanel three: Stargirl crashes into Grundy, knocking him off balance.\n\nStargirl: Gnnh!\n\nGrundy: Guh!\n\nStargirl CAP: I could lose control if I’m not careful.\n\nPanel four: Stargirl and Grundy both fall back out the window.\n\nStargirl CAP: I have to stick to what I know I can do.\n\nPanel five: Stargirl staggers up.\n\nStargirl CAP: But this time…\n\nPage eighteen: Three panels.\n\nPanel one: Close on Stargirl’s hand.  She tightens her grip on the staff.\n\nStargirl CAP: Well… I’m fighting an insane zombie cultist.  I might just need to let loose.\n\nPanel two: Tight on Stargirl.  She grits her teeth.\n\nStargirl CAP: Just this once.\n\nPanel three: On Grundy, still smiling away.\n\nGrundy: You still fail to comprehend.  You’re too blind to see that this is the way the world is meant to be!  Don’t you see how easily I convinced these men and women to spoil their morals?  Hardly any of them were hardened criminals, and yet here they are, pillaging and looting like the depraved beings they were *born* to be.\n\nStargirl CAP: God, this better work.\n\nPage nineteen: Three panels\n\nPanel one: Stargirl leaps into mid air, staff held up above her head ready to come crashing down.\n\nStargirl: ENOUGH!\n\nPanel two: Stargirl pounces on Grundy, the staff sinking into his chest, forcing his body to glow.  He looks down in shock.\n\nGrundy: Huh…?\n\nPanel three: On Stargirl.  She closes her eyes and clenches her jaw tight.\n\nStargirl CAP: Focus, Courtney.  *Focus*.  Don’t loose control!\n\nStargirl: Gnn…\n\nPage twenty: One panel\n\nPanel one: The staff blasts the biggest beam of energy left.  The yellow glow takes up almost the entire panel as Stargirl seems to get lost in it.  It pierces straight through Grundy’s chest as he’s rocked back, face contorted in agony for the first time.\n\nStargirl CAP: DON’T LOOSE CONTROL!\n\nStargirl: GAH!\n\nGrundy: AHH!\n\nSFX: BOOOOOOOOM!\n\nPage twenty-one: Seven panels\n\nPanel one: Stargirl is shocked back.\n\nStargirl CAP: For a second, the world goes silent.\n\nPanel two: Stargirl crashes on the ground.\n\nStargirl CAP: I worry that I took it too far.  I worry that I’m *dead*.\n\nPanel three: On Grundy, laying on the ground, seemingly dead, a smoking hole in his chest.\n\nStargirl CAP: But I get up and I realize… I did it.  I won.  I beat him.\n\nPanel four: A few of the robed cultists step from ruined storefronts to look at the beaten and battered body of their dear leader.  They’re shocked, faces ashen, muscles untensing.\n\nStargirl CAP: They come out slowly to look at him, and it’s like this wave of regret washes over them.  \n\nPanel five: On one of the robed men.  He takes down his hood in shock.\n\nStargirl CAP: They put him on such a high pedestal that his fall is devastating.  He convinced them that being corrupt and immoral, he was invincible.\n\nStargirl CAP 2: Clearly, that’s not the case.\n\nPanel six: Stargirl stands over Grundy’s body.\n\nStargirl CAP: But… was he right?  I blew a hole in his chest, fried his insides, but he’ll be back.  No matter what we do to him, he’ll always come back.  \n\nStargirl CAP 2: As it is, I only beat him by letting my anger take over for a moment, by embracing this deep and bitter hatred that had grown through the night.  It was… it was like it was a part of me.\n\nStargirl CAP 3: So really… who won here?\n\nNEXT: EPILOGUE \n\n","date":"2020-06-03T04:00:00.000Z","_id":"88e64755327e45ecadaf4485876bc8a6"},{"title":"The Cult of Solomon Grundy: Epilogue","number":"4","series":"e48ab4914f2e46a7a58fb2c1fb1ac303","author":"9ccaefa51e9b4d89ab2871aedc1b899f","editor":"df18d55a94d546aaa2686cf40bb7a5fe","content":"Stargirl #4\nThe Cult of Solomon Grundy: Epilogue\n\nPage one: One panel\n\nPanel one: The sun rises over Blue Valley.  Angle on Main Street, where shops bear broken windows and scorch marks.  Glass is scattered over the cracked asphalt of the street.  Signs hang askew and rubble is *everywhere*.  Ambulances park haphazardly at the curbs, as paramedics rush around, almost unsure of where to go first.  In the foreground stands JAY GARRICK, arms akimbo as he overlooks the damage done, his silver helmet shining in the brilliant sunlight.\n\nStargirl CAP: I don’t have what you would call a “normal life”.\n\nNewsreporter #1 (tailless)(elec.): ...reports finally coming out of the small Nebraskan town of Blue Valley following a disastrous attack by a terrorist group claiming to worship the criminal known as Solomon Grundy.\n\nNewsreporter #2 (tailless)(elec.): ...the lack of communication is now being linked to an experimental “blackout” device developed by LexCorp for the United States government as part of an exclusive contract signed less than two years ago.  The device was apparently stolen by the international crime organization Intergang, and supplied to Solomon Grundy…\n\nNewsreporter #3 (tailless)(elec.): ...hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property damage done overnight, leaving state and local legislators scrambling to...\n\nNewsreporter #4 (tailless)(elec.): There’s one thing we know for sure, though…\n\nTITLE AND CREDITS\n\nPage two: Seven panels\n\nPanel one: On Jay.  He hangs his head.  Stargirl, still pretty beat up from the previous issue, walks up behind him, leaning on her staff.\n\nNewsreporter #4 (tailless)(elec.):...the fine people of Blue Valley, Nebraska owe a huge debt of gratitude to their own local superhero, Stargirl.\n\nJay: We should’ve been here.\n\nStargirl: This isn’t your fault, Jay.\n\nStargirl CAP: I used to have one, just a few years ago.\n\nPanel two: Right hand shot of Stargirl’s face.  She’s tired, yet still retrospective.\n\nStargirl CAP: I was just starting high school, living with my mom in Beverly Hills.\n\nStargirl: Grundy and his maniacs are the only ones to blame.\n\nPanel three: On Jay, solemn.\n\nStargirl CAP: I had friends, I was on the gymnastics team, I was living in a cushy little apartment.  I thought I had it made.\n\nJay: I know that, Stars.  But you shouldn’t have had to deal with this alone.\n\nPanel four: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: I got out just fine.  Other than the bruises all over my back, the fat lip, the black eye, the dizzying amount of blood loss…\n\nStargirl CAP: And then it was all… ripped away.  We moved to Blue Valley, this podunk little town that could have had the tourist slogan “We’re sorry.  Are you lost?”. And we had to go with my new stepdad and constant pain in the ass, boring old Pat Dugan, to boot.\n\nPanel five: Angle behind Stargirl and Jay as they overlook the decimated Main Street.\n\nJay: I’m proud of you, Stars.  I mean that.  You handled this as well as an old hand like myself could have.  Hell, there’ve been times when it took the whole JSA to take Grundy down.\n\nStargirl CAP: And then I found an old box with a star-covered costume and belt.  Suddenly, boring old Pat wasn’t so boring any more.  To be fair, he was still a pain in the ass, though.\n\nPanel six: On Jay.\n\nJay: You should go get Doctor Mid-Nite to look you over.  Make sure Grundy didn’t do any serious damage.\n\nStargirl CAP: I took them both, mostly out of pure spite.  Even still, things changed.  The moment I clicked on that belt, my life wasn’t so normal anymore.  And it hasn’t been since.\n\nStargirl CAP2: Fighting shadow demons and alien hawk gods and foreign leaders/demigods… God, it’s only been two years, and yet it feels like a lifetime.  For the most part, it’s better.  Before, my life was, uh, what’s the word…?  \n\nStargirl CAP3: Vapid.  I think that’s it.  With the belt, I mean something.  I save lives and… and it feels great.  Most of the time, I don’t *want* to be normal.  But now… I worry Grundy was right.\n\nPanel seven: Stargirl flies up.  Jay looks up and waves her off.\n\nStargirl: He already gave me the all-clear.  I’ve… I’ve got some people to check in on, now.  Call me if Power Girl finds out anything about that Intergang sale.\n\nJay: Will do, Stars.\n\nStargirl CAP: I smile and wave, trying to act like everything is, well, obviously not *normal*, but at least like it’s *our* normal.\n\nPage three: One panel\n\nPanel one: On Stargirl as she flies through the clouds, soaking in the light of the rising sun, arms spread to her side like the wings of a bird, her staff held firmly in her left hand.  She smiles and closes her eyes in a moment of blissful escapism.\n\nStargirl CAP: I shouldn’t listen to Grundy.  He is (or was?) an insane zombie man who doesn’t have half a brain most of the time he’s alive.\n\nStargirl CAP2: But even still… there’s this sinking feeling in my gut that says he’s right.  I *hate* to even think about things like that, but… he’ll always be around.  For the next thousand years, he’s going to be out there hurting people.  I didn’t stop him today.  I… I just put a speed bump in front of him. And even to do that I had to blow a hole in his chest, which practically proves his whole “violence is human nature” schtick.  \n\nStargirl CAP3: And that’s not even thinking about guys like Black Adam (god, I really don’t want to think about him right now) and any other would-be dictators who also happen to be practically immortal.  \n\nStargirl CAP4: There’s *always* going to be another bad guy to punch, another world-ending *crisis* to stop.  I could be at this my entire life… and in the end, it still might not matter.\n\nStargirl CAP5: I keep telling myself to stop thinking about all of this.  I feel so damn hopeless right now and… and that’s not who I am.  But for the first time… I wish I *could* be normal.\n\nStargirl CAP6: Like, I’ve got all this other stuff to worry about, all this normal seventeen-year-old crap that’s going on too, and… and that feels even more pointless.  Why do I care about college when the multiverse is about to explode every other Wednesday?  What’s the point of an SAT when Darkseid could just decide that he's tired of Earth and is going to try and invade again?\n\nStargirl CAP7: It’s… smothering, almost.  Suffocating.  Save the world, go to school, oh, and don’t forget that the 24 hour news cycle makes everything newsworthy, so there’s a bajillion grown adults criticising my ever waking breath.\n\nStargirl CAP8: I thought I didn’t care about all this stuff before.  Like, it was there, but it all felt like it meant something.  I wasn’t just some girl from Beverly Hills anymore.  I was saving the Earth and kicking bad guy butt on a regular basis.  But now it’s different, somehow.  \n\nPage four: Four widescreen panels\n\nPanel one: We’re watching a *View* style talk show now (we’ll get to a reason in a minute, just hold your horses).  The set is clean, decorated mostly in white and pastel blue.  Four women (from left to right: Vicki Vale, Tawny Young, Lia Briggs and Lucy Lane) sit as a smooth white table in front of a large screen displaying the logo for *The Scene*.  Their names flash up on the screen beneath them.\n\nStargirl CAP: It’s all just always there, now.\n\nVicki Vale: ...in other news, the crisis in Blue Valley seems to have finally come to a close this morning, with the JSA arriving on the scene to deal with any remaining clean up.  It’s become very clear, however, that the hero of the night was clearly the internet famous heroine known as Stargirl.\n\nLucy Lane: Are we sure she’s really the best role model for all the kids out there?  I mean, I’m glad she saved the town and all, but that *costume*... there’s nothing to it!  And she’s only seventeen!\n\nPanel two: Angle on Lia Briggs and Lucy Lane talking to each other, not quite confrontationally, but it’s clear these two disagree fairly often.\n\nLia Briggs: Oh, here we go.  She’s a young girl who’s proud of who she is.  That should be encouraged, not shamed.  Aside from positively impacting her community, she’s also promoting a sense of body positivity that’s needed in this day and age.\n\nLucy Lane: Oh, sure, it’s easy for a skinny little white girl to do that, but would you be so supportive if she were--\n\nPanel three: On Tawny Young and Vicki Vale.  Tawny points almost accusionaly at Lucy, who remains off panel.\n\nTawny Young: You better hope you weren’t about to say what I *thought* you were about to say.  And besides, does it even matter what she’s wearing?  She kicked ass last night!  She saved *lives*.  You ask me, and that’ll always be more important than what she's wearing or how many Instavid followers she has.\n\nVicki Vale: But we can’t really expect that those things won’t impact what she’s trying to do, can we?  Everyday she gets more popular on social media, especially given that she’s one of the few teenage superheroes to come out with their secret identity.  Her career is going to be different than someone like Superman or Wonder Woman--\n\nPanel four: Pan out.  Angle on the entire panel.\n\nTawny Young:  *Everything* is different than it was before Superman showed up.  But that’s not really the point.  She’s not even old enough to vote yet, but she’s flying around the country putting her life in danger.  Is that even… ethical?\n\nLia Briggs: I’d have to agree on *that* point.  I mean, can you imagine the stress all this puts on her?\n\nStargirl CAP: Always there.\n\nPage five: Four panels\n\nPanel one: In the Dugan-Whitmore house.  The living room to be precise.  It’s a bit of a mess after the kerfuffle from last issue, but for the most part it’s still more orderly than the rest of Blue Valley.  Police officers swarm the room as PAT talks with chief of police LIZA WARNER, a tall, muscular woman with short trimmed blonde hair.\n\nWarner: You’re lucky you acted so fast.\n\nPat: I’ve been in the superhero business long enough to know how to be prepared.\n\nWarner (2): On that note, thank your stepdaughter for me.  We’re over budget as it is.  If it weren’t for Stargirl, this whole Grundy mess would’ve put us over the edge.  They give the cops in the big cities friggin’ tanks like it’s a warzone,  but we practically have to outsource everytime some kid decides to steal a pack of Chicken Whizzes from the corner store.\n\nWarner (3): Sorry.  I’m going off on one of my tangents.  My point is, your stepdaughter did a lot of good last night.\n\nPanel two: Tight on Pat.  He smiles.\n\nPat: Yeah.  She’s a good kid…\n\nPanel three: On Pat and Warner.\n\nPat: So are you new around here?  Don’t think I’ve seen you before…\n\nWarner: Just transferred the other week from Ivy Town, actually. Chief Liza Warner. \n\nPat (2): Well, it’s good to have you around, Chief Warner.\n\nWarner (2): Thanks… well, if that’s it, we’d better get going.  There’s still a lot of work to get done out there.\n\nPanel four: On Pat.  He waves.\n\nPat: Well… good luck out there.\n\nPage six: Five panels\n\nPanel one: Same on Pat.\n\nPanel two: Same.  Pat looks out of the corner of his eye.\n\nPanel three: Same.  Pat notices something, his mouth agape, not in surprise, but more in frustration.\n\nPanel four: Pat spins around to face whatever he saw.\n\nPat: Mike…\n\nPanel five: On Mike, leaning against the wall like a miniaturized James Dean.  He holds the S.T.R.I.P.E. arm from last issue.\n\nMike: What?  You said we would talk about it later--\n\nPage seven: Six panels\n\nPanel one: Pat yanks the arm away from Mike, much to the younger Dugan’s chagrin.\n\nPat: When I said “we’ll talk about this later”, I meant I would tell you “no” later.\n\nPanel two: On Mike, pleading.\n\nMike: Aw, c’mon.  Courtney was barely older than me when she took the belt!  What’s so different about me!?\n\nPanel three: On Pat, looking at the arm.\n\nPat: The difference is Courtney took the belt without permission and ended up in a situation where she was way out of her depth at the time.  She got roped up in all of this.  I don’t want the same to happen to you.\n\nPanel four: On Mike.\n\nMike: But think about it!  The giant hunk of metal out there wouldn’t go to waste!  It’d be Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. again.  Or maybe Stripsey if that would make you feel better.\n\nPanel five: On Pat.\n\nPat: Why would that-- look, son, you’re missing the point.  I’d rather Courtney wasn’t involved in this either, but at this point, I don’t have much say in the matter.  Even still, everytime she goes out there, I know there’s a possibility that she’s not coming back.  And I can’t go through that with you, too.\n\nPanel six: Pat walks away solemnly. \n\nPat: I… I just can’t.  \n\nPage eight: Two panels\n\nPanel one: Aerial shot of the street where Stargirl and Grundy first clashed last issue, the damage still scarred into the pavement.  Stargirl lowers from the sky.\n\nStargirl CAP: Last night, I noticed that Grundy came out of a house around here.  I don’t know what he did, but I have to make sure that--\n\nPanel two: Angle on the Cartmill house from issues one and two.  Police cars flock around the front.  Police tape hangs from the door frame.\n\nStargirl CAP: Oh no.\n\nPage nine: Three panels\n\nPanel one: Stargirl touches down.  An officer turns from his squad car.\n\nStargirl CAP: Nonononononononono\n\nStargirl: What happened here?\n\nOfficer: You can’t be here.\n\nPanel two: Stargirl whips out her JSA ID card.\n\nStargirl: I’m with the JSA.\n\nPanel three: On the officer, who clearly doesn’t want to take any crap.\n\nOfficer: Look, kid.  This isn’t a game.  You wanna use that card for a discount at Starbrand, be my guest.  But it doesn’t give you--\n\nPage ten: Five panels\n\nPanel one: Stargirl pushes past the officer and marches up towards the porch.\n\nStargirl: Now is *not* the time.\n\nOfficer: Hey!\n\nPanel two: Stargirl rips through the police tape and walks through the front door.\n\nOfficer (OP): You can’t go in there!\n\nStargirl CAP: My stomach churns.  I can already smell the blood.\n\nPanel three: Angle on Stargirl’s horrified face as she enters the house.\n\nStargirl CAP: It’s… it’s worse than I could have imagined.\n\nPanel four: Pull out.  We can’t see the crime scene-- save for a bit of blood that’s been splattered across the wall-- but we can tell it’s awful.  Stargirl stands, dumbfounded, hands over her mouth.  We see a CSI canvassing the scene.\n\nStargirl CAP: It’s… why couldn’t I stop Grundy sooner?  Why couldn’t I--\n\nUnknown (OP): Courtney?\n\nPanel five: Angle over Stargirl’s shoulder on EMMA CARTMILL, who sits in the doorway of the kitchen with a detective who holds a notepad.  \n\nStargirl: Emma…\n\nPage eleven: Four widescreen panels\n\nPanel one: Similar set up to Page Four, except now we’re watching a political talk show akin to Tucker Carlson.  We see G. Gordon Godfrey sitting at a jet black desk in front of a screen that shows a waving American flag.  A selfie of Stargirl (with an Instavid watermark in the right hand corner) is displayed over his shoulder.  \n\nGodfrey: So Stargirl saved her hometown last night.  And I want to, from the bottom of my heart, congratulate her one a job well done.  But, should we really have to depend on some teenaged internet star to save us?  \n\nPanel two: Closer on Godfrey.\n\nGodfrey: The fine men and women of the United States Military and our local police forces go through months of training before being given the responsibility of saving our great country.\n\nPanel three: On Godfrey.\n\nGodfrey: And Stargirl… well, she isn’t even *old* enough to join those forces, let alone have that same training.  So why, my fellow Americans, are we entrusting our lives to children like this?  Where was the “Just Us” League, the bloated, fascist, superpowered police force that’s *supposed* to be in charge of things like this?  Why do we entrust them with our safety and security if they’re willing to just ignore the plight of the common man, allowing this to fall to a teenager, who’s probably more interested in selling out for internet fame than saving lives?\n\nPanel four: On Godfrey, suddenly a lot more pleasant.\n\nGodfrey: That’s all for the show tonight, but before I send you loyal patriots off, I want to show my debt of gratitude to tonight’s sponsor Chocos, who make it possible for me to save America with the unabridged truth that you won’t get from the mainstream media.  Chocos, for when you need a pure chocolatey pick-me-up at the end of a long day.\n\nPage twelve: Five panels\n\nPanel one: Back on Main Street.  Jay speaks with a paramedic as HOURMAN rushes up behind him.\n\nHourman: Jay!\n\nPanel two: Jay spins around.\n\nJay: Rick!  What is?\n\nPanel three: On Hourman and Jay.\n\nHourman: I just got word from Power Girl.  They tracked the Intergang sale to one of Helix’s old compounds in the Pacific.  \n\nJay: Patch me in.\n\nPanel four: Jay puts his finger up to his ear.\n\nJay: Karen.  What’s going on?\n\nPower Girl (elec.)(tailless): Well, the good news is, we managed to secure the base and found out who was in charge of this particular operation.\n\nPanel five: On Power Girl, hand on her hip, biting her lip.  Wildcat is in the background, fighting through a few Intergang guards.\n\nJay (elec.)(tailless): And the bad news?\n\nPower Girl: Well…\n\nWildcat: Yah!\n\nPage thirteen: One panel\n\nPanel one: Angle behind Power Girl as she looks at a massive computer screen with a single image on it.  The ugly, gnarled visage of ULTRA-HUMANITE.\n\nPower Girl: We found out who was in charge of this particular operation.\n\nPage fourteen: Four panels.\n\nPanel one: Stargirl solemnly walks out of the Cartmill house, her arm around Emma.\n\nPanel two: Close on the two of them, as Stargirl comforts the distraught Emma.  She’s in tears.\n\nPanel three: The officer tries to stop them.  Stargirl ignores him.\n\nPanel four: Stargirl and Emma walk off into the horizon.\n\nPage fifteen: Five panels\n\nPanel one: A while later, Stargirl and Emma sit at the edge of a building, overlooking Main Street.  Things have started to clear up a little.\n\nEmma: I… thank you.  I… I needed to get out of there…\n\nStargirl: Emma…\n\nPanel two: On Emma, in tears.\n\nEmma: I… I hid.  The… the big guy… he told the others to kill my mom and… and my brother and me and… and I hid.  I don’t know how I survived, but--\n\nPanel three: On Stargirl, looking concerned.\n\nStargirl: Emma, I… it’ll be--\n\nPanel four: On Emma, her head hanging.\n\nEmma: They’re gone… I don’t even… what’s the point?  They’re gone and… and why am I not?  How… how is that ever going to be okay?\n\nPanel five: On Stargirl, unsure of what to say.\n\nPage sixteen: Nine panel grid.\n\nPanel one: On Emma.\n\nEmma: It… it doesn’t feel like there’s a point anymore.  Nothing… nothing I can do will ever make up for that.  And… I… I can’t close my eyes without seeing it.  I… I don’t want to--\n\nPanel two: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: I… I know it can be hard.  \n\nPanel three: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: Sometimes… sometimes it feels like it would just be easier to curl into a ball and give up.\n\nPanel four: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: It’s easy to think there’s no point.  That… that everything is just going to keep going wrong, no matter how much you try to do.\n\nPanel five: On Stargirl, starting to think she might not just be talking to Emma.\n\nStargirl: Like nothing you do will ever matter.\n\nPanel six: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: But… we have to keep going.\n\nPanel seven: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: We have to keep trying.  We have to keep hoping.  And one day… one day hopefully it’ll all matter.  No matter what stacks up against us…\n\nPanel eight: On Stargirl.\n\nStargirl: One day it’ll all be worth it.  As long as we keep going.\n\nPanel nine: On Emma, looking off into the distance, the tears on her cheeks drying.\n\nPage seventeen: One panel.\n\nPanel one: Angle from behind.  Emma leans up against Stargirl as they look into the rising sun.\n\nPage eighteen: Four panels\n\nPanel one: On Stargirl flying through the bright sky.\n\nStargirl CAP: Things eventually started getting back to normal.\n\nPanel two: In the school hallway.  Courtney stands there as people pass.\n\nStargirl CAP: They closed school for about a week, but eventually they let things get back on schedule.\n\nPanel three: In an abandoned warehouse. On Stargirl as she fights Kobra agents alongside Hourman and Power Girl.  Stargirl blasts one with her staff, while Power Girl throws Hourman into a crowd of them.\n\nStargirl: I’m still going with the JSA on the weekend and whenever I can.  We’re still investigating Ultra-Humanite, but Mister Terrific promises that he’s getting close.\n\nPanel four: On Emma, sitting on a plush looking bed.\n\nStargirl CAP: Emma’s staying with us until everything… gets sorted out.  She doesn’t talk much anymore, but… she’s trying.  I think she took my words to heart.  And I think I’ve done the same.  \n\nPage nineteen: A collection of Tweets (or whatever the DCW equivalent is.  Twits maybe?) with the caption boxes in between.\n\nStargirl CAP: It’s still not easy.  But even if I had a “normal life”, I doubt it would-be.\n\n@LexCorpOfficial tweet: We here at LexCorp stand with the people of #BlueValley, and promise to help reinvigorate it, along with small towns like it across the nation, through funding and job opportunities.\n\nStargirl CAP2: I feel like I’m getting sappy with all the “hope” talk, but it’s true.  It’s what keeps me going.\n\n@GGordonGodfreyShow tweet: We offer our thoughts and prayers to the people of #BlueValley in these trying times.\n\nStargirl CAP3: The only way to live life is to believe that tomorrow will always be better than yesterday.  Sometimes that’s hard.  But as much as Grundy made me doubt it, being with the JSA gets me through it.  Helping the world get better tomorrow gets me through it.\n\n@BatJamags tweet: Stargirl’s great and all, but I mean, come on, Batman would have looked way cooler fighting the giant zombie guy.\n\nStargirl CAP4: Honestly, I don’t think “normal lives” are all they’re cracked up to be.\n\n@mysterious_stranger tweet: Shout out to @StargirlWhitmore for some serious badassery in #BlueValley.  The superhero of Gen Z, I’m #$%&ing calling it right now.\n\nStargirl CAP5: I get to do something meaningful like this.  And really, what else could I ask for?  Normal doesn’t matter when being abnormal means you can save the world, even if it’s just one life at a time.\n\n@hopeandlegoes tweet: #BlueValley has officially announced the closing of the KF Museum after damage during the Grundy attack, and will replace it with a new museum dedicated to the history of American superheroes, all leading to a Stargirl exhibit.  Thoughts?\n\nPage twenty: Six panels\n\nPanel one: In Pat’s garage, Mike sits at the workbench, fiddling with a few loose nuts and bolts.  Pat descends the stairs.\n\nStargirl CAP: The world will always need heroes.\n\nPat: Uh, Mike?\n\nPanel two: Mike looks up.\n\nMike: Yeah, yeah. I know.  I won’t touch the suit again.\n\nPanel three: Pat steps behind Mike, clapping a hand on his shoulder.\n\nPat: That’s not what I was gonna, say.

And one day…\n\nPanel six: Angle on the S.T.R.I.P.E. suit.\n\nPat (OP): ...you might just be ready to be the next S.T.R.I.P.E.

They recharge eventually, sure, but he still only has so many. And when any one of them gets contaminated, it’s a real danger to him. But Ra’s wasn’t the first one to unlock the Pits. And this map was supposed to have _hundreds_ more suitable locations, all uncharted.

Something like that.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nSimilar to the previous shot, except that Bronze Tiger is blocking a flying kick from RICHARD DRAGON.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nWell, anyway, that was where Richard and Shiva found me. Guess they’d been on my trail the whole time, and they’d finally caught up with me.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium action shot. Bronze Tiger and Richard Dragon are now locked in intense combat, grappling with each other. Neither Shiva nor Bronze Tiger’s partner are anywhere in sight.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nI only half remember it, but I can tell you it was a hell of a fight.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium action shot. Bronze Tiger and Dragon have taken their fight back out into the rest of the temple, and are smashing the hell out of the place as collateral damage.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nI didn’t make it real easy on him…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Ben’s face as he snaps out of the brainwashing, Richard Dragon pinning him down.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\n… but eventually, Richard got through to me. And we decided that if this place had kept that map from the League all these years… it could keep it from them a while longer. Guess we should’ve just burned it, but… I don’t know. It didn’t feel right, destroying something like that. And we thought that no one else would ever know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. Richard helps Ben back to his feet.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nBut I guess they figured it out anyway. That’s why I’m here. To get it before they can.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nYou think… partner… told?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nOh. That. No, it’s not that.

He knows where the line is.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. The assassin, bleeding from his lip, looks up at Cass.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nASSASSIN\nWhat's your interest in this? How did the Bats get involved?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up.

Cass bites her lip.\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN**\nFive panels, one full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Cass bends her knees slightly, leaning towards the assassin.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nAnswer… us. And I answer you.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up. The assassin looks up at Cass, apparently assessing.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. The assassin's shoulders sag.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nASSASSIN\nIt was a guess. O-Sensei's old school was never _that_ secret. And we knew _one_ of you must have the map.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up. Cass nods, looking satisfied.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nNot Bats. Shiva is my mother.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on the assassin. He looks shocked, and suddenly a lot more worried. In fact, he's sweating slightly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (OFFSCREEN)\nDo you know where she is?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nFour panels, stacked.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nThe assassin hangs his head and LAUGHS.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nASSASSIN\nFunny.

What does the Sensei want?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on the assassin. He's starting to look worse for the wear.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nASSASSIN\nThere's been a shake-up in the League. Ra's won't be in charge much longer. His time is almost up.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on the assassin. He's clearly now _very_ ill, pale and sweating, and, most alarmingly, blood now trickling out of his eyes and nose.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nASSASSIN\nAnd so… so is… mine…\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (OFFSCREEN)\nOh, shit!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN**\nSeven panels, two rows of three and one full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. The assassin's head lolls back against his chair. Ben is leaning over him, examining. Richard watches, unreadable. Cass, however, seems notably upset, both hands covering her mouth.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nDamn. Poison.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot as Ben stands up.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nI didn't see any capsules when I tied him up. Must have been something inside him.

Get more from them. Good cop/bad cop worked the first time...\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (OFFSCREEN)\nBut…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Cass. She's looking at the two of them, looking horrified.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\n… They'll... die, too.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot. Ben and Richard both stare at Cass for a moment.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nZoom in on Richard's face, his expression surprised but appraising.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYou know. I didn't ask. What's your name?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (OFFSCREEN)\nCassandra. Cass.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nCassandra, huh?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium two-shot of Richard and Cass as he wheels towards the door, going deeper into the building.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nWalk with me a moment, will you?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN**\nSeven panels, one full-width and two rows of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot from behind as Cass and Richard move along side by side. The halls of the building are fairly plain, modest and simple, but there are a mix of both art and weapons mounted at varying heights.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYou're awfully gentle. You know that?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up. Cass looks away and down.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (OFFSCREEN)\nIt's a compliment. It speaks to your character.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nSide two-shot. The pair come to a door to what is clearly Richard's bedroom. It's modest, and old, albeit with a few modern wheelchair-friendly updates.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nIf it's not too personal… who's your father?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nDavid Cain. Why?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Richard. For the first time, his expression turns dark, scowling. He knows this name, and it's not a fond association\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nRight. Of _course._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nOver-the-shoulder shot of Richard as he passes through the door.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nFor a moment, I thought maybe… but no. It's impossible.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Cass. She looks confused.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nWhat?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up of Cass, only now her look is one of comprehension.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nOh.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nSeven panels, one full-width and two rows of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Cass follows Richard into the room.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nShe… loves you. Doesn't she?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Richard. He's not looking at Cass, staring straight ahead, but he smiles wryly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDRAGON\nMaybe you should ask _her_ that when we find her.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Cass. She looks thoughtful.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nI think… if I ask her… she'll kill you.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nAnother close-up of Richard, who's actively laughing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nHa!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYeah. She will.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium two-shot. Richard is reaching into a cupboard, while Cass stands behind him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nLet me ask you this. Why do you think I retired? Why do you think I disappeared into obscurity?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nBecause… injured?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up of Richard, as viewed from inside the cupboard. He's reaching for a small BOX.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nNo. That was a convenient reason, but that's not it. Shiva made me an offer. I could have rebuilt all that I lost in that last fight. But I didn't.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot of Richard. He's turned around, box in his lap.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nBecause I saw what I was becoming. And I saw what _she_ was becoming. I knew one day… one of us would kill the other. We'd have no choice.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up of Cass, who's frowning.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nAlways… a choice.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD  (OFFSCREEN)\nThat's true.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot of Richard. He's holding the box in his hands, but hasn't opened it yet, instead looking up at Cass.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nWhich is why I made _my_ choice first. I chose to disappear, instead of living the rest of my life as Lady Shiva's Last Weakness.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Cass, staring down at Richard.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nBecause you love her.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up as Richard smiles, eyes twinkling with wry amusement.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nWhat makes you say that? Maybe I just want to live.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Cass gives him a level stare, arms crossed.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Richard laughs.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nOkay. You got me.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on the box in Richard's lap. He's opened it, but the lid is blocking our view of the contents.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (OFFSCREEN)\nBut that's not what I wanted to talk to you about.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (OFFSCREEN)\nThen…?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Richard. He's hesitating over something.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nI--\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (OFFSCREEN)\nHey. Not to rush you or anything, but --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot of Ben, leaning in through the doorway.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\n-- we've got a couple dozen assassins who are gonna wake up any moment, and more incoming.

Two figures opposite each other, a man and a woman. The man is standing, training a gun at the woman. There’s a calculating, assessing glint in his eyes. He’s wearing a black bodysuit, the white silhouette of a wolf stretching across it. Something about his face is familiar, too… he has Cass’s jawline, after all. It’s DAVID CAIN. The woman opposite him is half-kneeling, holding a clearly broken arm, but still looking upwards. Her expression is pure murder, and unrestrained fury at that… she looks devastated.

She’s an Asian woman, dressed similarly to the other patrons… red dress, flat dress shoes, long, perfectly styled hair. Agewise, she’s indeterminate, but her bearing is that of someone in her forties by now. Perfect posture. Sharp eyes. Perfectly at ease, except that something about the way she holds herself says she might jump up and kill you at any moment. And, of course, a striking resemblance to our titular character. We saw her on the first page. It’s LADY SHIVA.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBABS (VO)\nAnd I’m worried that if you don’t realize that…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up on the arrival’s face.

Cass and Shiva sit at the table across from each other. They both have mugs of tea. Cass is looking at the menu, eyebrows furrowed in concentration, while Shiva's menu sits folded in front of her.

Now she’s the one who doesn't look up from her menu.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nNo.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Cass turns to the waiter beside her, who appears to have arrived to take their orders.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nUh… veggie burger. And fries. Please.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot.

Cass shrugs casually, unconcerned.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nDamian says… don't eat Bat-Cow.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up.

Shiva continues to study Cass intently.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nYour father never intended you to care for yourself. Your beloved Bats appear woefully unable to teach you. So I impart this lesson upon you: mind what you consume as carefully as you mind the rest of your training. It has immeasurable impact upon your body.

Cassandra speaks as she shovels fries into her mouth by the handful.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nUh-huh.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up. Shiva's eyes narrow slightly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nIn combat, your form is nearly flawless. Yet in every other area, you show an utter lack of discipline.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Cass looks up at Shiva. She's holding her burger with both hands. There is ketchup on her shirt.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nSo?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up. Shiva is not eating, just drilling through Cassandra with her eyes.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nSo you squander your potential.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up.

Lotta copy and paste in this sequence, not gonna lie.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nDo nothing half-heartedly. Do nothing without intention. Do this, and you will never be helpless. Do you understand?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up. Cass looks directly at Shiva, now matching her intensity for the first time.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nMore than… you think.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Shiva's lip curls slightly, and she cuts into her steak, now looking at her food.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nDo not try to read me, Cassandra. You aren't that skilled yet.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (OFFSCREEN)\nUh-huh.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot.

It’s been too long.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Shiva. Her expression is flat and inscrutable.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI see you’re still using that ridiculous chair.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Richard. He looks amused, scratching his beard.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nI know, I know. If it'd been you, you'd have stopped at nothing to retrain your body until you no longer needed it, right?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva walks past Richard, no longer looking at him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nIf it had been me, I would not have been carelessly injured in the first place.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nGlad to see the years have mellowed you out, Shiva.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (OFFSCREEN)\nEnough chit-chat.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Ben. His expression is hard, and he looks focused.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nShiva, not that I’m not happy to see you, but we have bigger priorities. The Sensei is after the Map --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA (OFFSCREEN)\nYou are all, I see, several steps behind.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TEN**\nSeven panels, two rows of three and one full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot, Cass POV, of Shiva, Richard and Ben. Shiva walks ahead of the group, her back to them, with Ben and Richard following.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nThen you _are_ the one who took the Map?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nTook it? Don’t be ridiculous.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Shiva, looking over her shoulder back at the group.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI _destroyed_ it, of course.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium group reaction shot. Richard looks surprised, while Cass is staring at Shiva, apparently assessing. Ben, however, just looks slightly angry.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nShiva, we _needed_ that. The information on that map --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA (OFFSCREEN)\nWas memorized long ago.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva continues to walk, while Cass scrutinizes her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI consented to your initial wishes to leave the Map in its place. That hardly means I did not _look_ at it.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (OFFSCREEN)\nOkay, sure. But we still have another problem.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Ben.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nLook, maybe we _are_ still playing catch-up. But something big is going on in the League right now. Ra’s is ill, the Sensei’s trying to take over, and somehow, Sensei knows a _lot_ of things he was never supposed to know. We need to find out where the hell he’s getting his information --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva, still at the front, looks down ever so slightly. Cassandra stares at her from over her shoulder, like she’s looking through her.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Cass’s eyes, slightly widened.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nMom...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nWide group shot.

Her expression is completely blank, guarded.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nSame shot as before, except now Shiva’s lips have parted, just enough to speak.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI have long been engaged in a war against Ra’s al Ghul.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Ben, looking like he’s an inch away from a string of profanities.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nShiva. Tell me you _didn’t_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Shiva. She’s staring straight forward.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI have, over the years, enlisted the aid of many allies in this battle. The Sensei showed promise as a useful tool.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up of Richard, who looks genuinely disappointed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYou told the Sensei where to find the Map, didn’t you?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Shiva. Her head is turned slightly down and to the side.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI offered him small amounts of information, in turn for answers of my own.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up of Cass. She’s just staring at Shiva.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up. Shiva tilts her head backwards, chin up.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI offer neither apology nor excuse. Battles are not won without risk.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nClose-up. Shiva’s eyes slide downward slightly, looking at the ground.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nHowever. The Sensei has grown more powerful than I expected. It is he whom I must now target.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWELVE**\nFive panels, one full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium group shot. Richard has one hand on his temple. Cass is standing with her arms at her side, looking surprisingly sympathetic. Ben, however, looks like he’s an inch away from facepalming.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nSo let me get this straight.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nAfter you and Richard freed me from the League -- who _kidnapped and brainwashed me_ -- you went to work with them anyway, with the guy who _killed your sister_.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nThen when Ra’s turned out to be exactly who you should have known he was, you left, and worked with the _Sensei_ instead?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nAnd then when _he_ turned out to be _exactly who you should have known he was_, you, what? Destroyed the Map and went into hiding?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA (OFFSCREEN)\n_Enough._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot of Shiva, from Ben’s POV. Her body is still facing forwards, away from the group, but she’s whipped her head around, glaring.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI will not be lectured like a _child_. And I will not be lectured by those who _abandoned_ the causes they swore to. Richard, cowering in your old home like a beaten dog. Benjamin, trading Ra’s al Ghul for Amanda Waller. Cassandra, perpetually soft and half-finished.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on Shiva’s murderous expression.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nTell me. What did you expect when you sought me out? What _fantasy_ did you concoct for this scenario? Did you believe I would welcome you with open arms? Did you believe yourself grand _superheroes_, come to save the day? I am _Lady Shiva._ I do not surrender. I cannot be stopped. And I have no need of any of you.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Shiva turns her head forward and continues to walk, away from the group.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot. Cass runs after Shiva to catch up, reaching towards her. Shiva does not look at her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nMom --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\n_What_?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN**\nSeven panels, two rows of three and one full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up on Cass. Her eyebrows are drawn together in concentration as she struggles for words.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nJust because… don’t _need_ help… doesn’t mean… won’t… help.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Shiva’s eyes, darting towards Cass.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nStrength cannot be obtained through clinging to unnecessary crutches.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on Cass’s challenging expression.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nThought you… wanted… teach me.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Shiva. She’s staring at Cass, assessing.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Shiva. She’s turning her head away, evidently discounting with what she sees.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nYou are not ready to accept the lessons I have for you, Cassandra.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nShiva continues to walk away from the rest of the group.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI am aware of your natures. I am aware you will attempt to _follow_ me. I warn you _once._ I seek no quarrel with any of you. But get in my way… and I will _remove_ you.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nGroup reaction shot. Richard’s shaking his head, looking almost amused. Ben, however, has his arms folded, frowning. Cass just looks stricken, arms at her side.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYour mom’s fun.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN**\nSix panels, all flashback. One full-width, one row of two, and one row of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFlashback panel, wide exterior shot of a tall mountain.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nSo … what now?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION CAPTION\nNepal. Dhaulagiri Mountain. Twenty years ago.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium group shot. Three people. The first, Lady Shiva herself, looking about the same as she always does. She’s got a sword slung over her back, and, despite the fact that twenty years before the comic’s setting is in the last nineties to early 2000s, she’s wearing a jumpsuit that _screams_ ‘70s. She dares you to say anything about it. The second, Benjamin Turner, looking much as we saw him in the flashback of Issue One, except absent his Bronze Tiger mask. He looks tired, but determined.  And finally, beside them, we have RICHARD DRAGON in his prime… cleanshaven, chair nowhere in sight, with the jade DRAGON CLAW necklace prominent on his neck. There’s a faint aura around him in the shape of an actual dragon.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nWide group shot. The Dragon trio are in the midst of climbing up the mountain, all rappelling up a rope, climbing picks in hand.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Shiva’s face. She looks focused and intense.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nWe find Sensei.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Richard’s face. His eyes look almost blank, his face neutral. Still got that dragon aura.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nWhich we do… how?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Ben’s face. He looks pissed and determined, ready for revenge.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nI have an idea. But I hate it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN**\nSix panels, all present day. One full-width, one row of two, and one row of three.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide exterior shot of a tall mountain.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION CAPTION\nNepal. Dhaulagiri Mountain. Now.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nYou’ve got access to the Bat files, right? Well, we know Shiva told Sensei some things she shouldn’t have.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium group shot. Three people. The first, Cass herself, back in her Batgirl outfit. No mask, but she has found herself a scarf and some earmuffs. The second, Benjamin Turner, back in his cold weather outfit from Issue One. He looks resigned. And finally, beside them, we have Richard Dragon, present day. Long beard, still in his chair, but the jade DRAGON CLAW necklace is still prominent on his neck. The aura, however, is missing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nBut… she… broke Map. Right? So where… no. Wait.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nYeah, you’ve got it, don’t you?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nIf all she’d told him was where the Map was, our problem would be solved already.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nWide group shot. The trio are in the midst of climbing up the mountain, all rappelling up a rope, climbing picks in hand. Cass has Richard's wheelchair collapsed and slung across her back, and Richard climbs up between them, using only his arms. Ben takes up the rear behind him, ready to help if he needs.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Cass’s face. She looks focused and intense.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nSo… told him… something _else_. Something… important. But what…?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Richard’s face. His face is soft, but his expression is determined.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nOh. Oh, _no_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Ben’s face. He looks resolutely determined.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nYeah. That’s what I’m thinking, too.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN**\nFive panels, all flashback. One full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot of a courtyard, and set back within it, a temple carved from the mountain stone itself, similar to the one we saw in Issue One. It is FULL of guards, all dressed in cold-weather ninja gear, armed with various weaponry both traditional and modern.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nWhat?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nBut are you sure it’s _there_? There’s a hundred different Lazarus Pits.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nNot like this one. You _know_ it’d have been the first thing he asked for. Maybe even before the Map.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\n_What?_\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nThis is going to require some context here.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium three-shot. Ben and Richard both crouch behind cover at the edge of the Courtyard. Richard looks concerned; Ben looks focused. In the background, Shiva is standing, approaching the edge of the rock they’re sheltering behind.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nFor years, the Sensei’s health had been declining, yet Ra’s had kept him from the Pits. I guess eventually, he had enough. He revolted openly and tried to overthrow Ra’s.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nAnd as his first move, he’d set his sights on _one_ Pit in particular. A special one.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (WHISPER)\nLook, Ben. Are you sure you’re okay for this? You haven’t really rested since we got you back --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (WHISPER)\nI’m not sitting this one out, Rich. I’ve seen what the Sensei can do. You _need_ me.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (WHISPER)\nI’m just worried that --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Shiva walks straight toward the Courtyard, apparently entirely unconcerned with such trifling things as “stealth” and “surprise.”\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nWhat’s… special?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (OFFSCREEN)\nShiva, wait --!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nWide shot. Shiva walks up towards the mass of guards, sword still slung on her back. The guards raise their weapons, reacting with hostile uncertainty.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI have heard it said that to _truly_ measure the talent of an artist, one should look not to his own work, but to that of his _students._ In this respect, your Sensei’s skill is legendary.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot of Shiva. She’s unsheathed her sword, holding it at the ready.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nShow me.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nFive panels, all present day. One full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot of a courtyard, and set back within it, that same temple carved from the mountain stone itself. It is also FULL of guards, all dressed in cold-weather ninja gear, armed with various weaponry both traditional and modern.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium three-shot. Ben and Richard both crouch behind cover at the edge of the Courtyard. Richard looks focused, though there’s sweat beading at the edges of his face despite the climate. Ben looks concerned. In the background, Cass is standing, approaching the edge of the rock they’re sheltering behind.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (WHISPER)\nHey, Rich. You gonna be okay? I know your legs aren’t quite --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (WHISPER)\nI’ll do what I have to, Ben. I’m not sitting this one out, and I can’t exactly sit this one _in_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Cass starts to round the edge of the rock, but she looks back in surprise as she is pulled back, Richard’s and Ben’s hands on either arm.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD AND BEN (OFFSCREEN SHARED BUBBLE, WHISPER)\n_No!_\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium three-shot. Ben and Richard have pulled Cass back down behind cover.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (WHISPER)\nLook, I don’t know even half of Shiva’s plan here. But if _she’s_ been laying low this entire time, then there must be a _reason_ for stealth here.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (WHISPER)\nSo let’s not sound the alarm unless we _have_ to, all right?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up of Cass. She frowns, but nods.\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN**\nNine panels, all flashback. One full-width and two rows of four. The lines of the panels are slanted, as action shots.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Shiva is entirely surrounded by ninja, who rush at her with weapons raised. She holds her stance, not moving.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nSo, here’s the thing. There are some theories that Lazarus Pits kind of… _keep_ a part of anyone who bathes in them. According to those theories, that’s what causes Pit Madness. Just the collected life force of everyone else who’s ever been in that Pit, screaming for control.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide shot. It’s the same as before, except for two changes. First, Shiva has changed her pose slightly, sword now extended by her side. Second, every single one of the surrounding assassins is scattered on the ground around her, unconscious or dead.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\n… is that… true?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot. Richard and Ben rush out from cover to join the fray, looking irritated.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Richard, Dragon aura in full effect, punches one of the ninja.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nWho knows? It’s an ancient mystical bath of chemicals. There’s about a million different things it could be. Doubt there’s only _one_ cause.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Ben kicks one of the ninja’s feet out from under them.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nIt’d explain why Ra’s is so _possessive_ about his Pits, anyway.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot from behind. Shiva, sword bloodied and at her side, walks through a swathe of fallen ninjas.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot. Richard dodges back as a knife slices up the side of his cheek.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Ben doubles over as the head of a mace hits him full in the gut.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot from inside the Temple. Shiva stands before the double doors of the Temple, opening them. There is blood all over her sword and her hands. She is, otherwise, completely unscathed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nSo far, I am not impressed.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nVOICE (OFFSCREEN)\nWell, if you have found the _students_ wanting...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN**\nNine-panel grid, present.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot of the Courtyard. The ninja continue their patrol, while the small figures of Cass, Richard and Ben wend their ways around the edges of the Courtyard.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot of Richard. His face is pained, and Ben catches him as he stumbles over a rock.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nBut whether it’s true for _all_ Pits or not, it’s _definitely_ true for _this_ one. See, every Lazarus Pit is a little bit different. They’ve all got their own little quirks. _This_ Pit has a _memory_. Everyone who bathes in it doesn’t just get _rejuvenated_… they get the vitality and the experience of _everyone_ who’s used it before them.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on one of the ninja. She seems alert, turning her head to the side and listening.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nGroup shot of Cass, Richard and Ben. They’re frozen in place, not moving.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nIf you have the mental fortitude for it, anyway. Most people who use it just _crack_. Completely lose all sense of self. It’s why they sealed it away hundreds of years ago. It’s why they call it… the _Savage Pit_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nOver-the-shoulder shot of the ninja, approaching the rocks behind which the group had been hiding.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nPOV shot, from the ninja’s perspective, of the group’s hiding spot. It’s completely empty, no sign of any disturbances.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nPan back to a group shot of Cass, Ben and Richard, all hanging behind one of the Courtyard’s pillars, climbing claws embedded into the stone. Richard has the Dragon aura now.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nTrue. But imagine what that would mean, to someone like the Sensei, with his iron mind. Techniques lost for ages, all at his command and ready to be _practiced_ with a flawless new body.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up of Richard’s eyes. They’ve got a yellowish tint now, a little wild.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nGroup shot as the trio drops back to the ground.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nOnly problem is… he couldn’t get _in_. It’s sealed _somewhere_ below a temple, but no one knows how to _get_ to it anymore. That Map we’ve been after, though… it has everything you need to find it. Well, had. But if Shiva memorized it, she must have known it. And if she told the Sensei...\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNINJA (VO)\nMaster. We’ve detected something… some type of energy signature. Intruders.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nTwo panels, one full-page splash and one inset in the lower right corner, all flashback.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nSplash panel. It’s a full-body shot of a shirtless Asian man. He’s aged, perhaps in his 70s, with a balding head full of white hair, but he looks in good condition for his years, corded muscles under scarred skin. There’s a glint of something dangerous in his dark brown eyes. It’s THE SENSEI.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nLet me put it this way. The Sensei kicked all our asses years ago, _without_ the Pit. If he’s gotten himself an _upgrade_?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nThen… Shiva’s… in trouble?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSENSEI\nPerhaps you would like to test the SENSEI?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Shiva.

And he was a legend. They said that he was the son of Ra’s al Ghul, destined to surpass his father. They said that he was the father of the same, allowing his son to inherit his empire of shadows.  They said that in his prime, he could defeat an army of a thousand men, and that he could do it single-handedly. They said that he could read you like a book, that he spoke war like a language.

But the one thing they could all agree on was that at some point, his relationship with Ra’s soured. Ra’s had singular control over the Lazarus Pits, and even as the Sensei’s health began to fail, he denied him its waters. By the time he kidnapped Ben, he was ready to turn. Took all the loyal assassins he’d trained over the years, and revolted openly. Had Ra’s on the ropes, too.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on Ben. He looks determined and fierce. Filled with righteous anger.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nProbably why the ancient son of a bitch tipped us to his location in the first place.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Shiva. She’s more emotive than her usual, actually smiling in anticipation. In her element and ready to fight.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nWorked with… Ra’s?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on the Sensei. He looks calm and intense, and despite his advanced years he carries an air of distinct danger.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nWe used to work for an organization. The Global Organization of Organized Defense. G.O.O.D. Our handler was a man named Barney Ling. I never really trusted him, honestly. But after the Sensei took Ben, a man came. He claimed to be the ultimate power behind G.O.O.D. A shadowy force for good in the world, acting in opposition to the Sensei.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nHe called himself… Ra’s al Ghul.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGES TWO AND THREE**\nTwo-page spread. Twenty-four panels as four rows of six.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nAction four-shot. Ben and Richard throw themselves at the Sensei, fists raised, leaping through the air. The Sensei and Shiva both stand there, the Sensei seemingly unconcerned, and Shiva watching, assessing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nThe Sensei we fought was an old man. His body was twisted and broken. He could barely manage to stand for more than about a minute, a minute and a half.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium action three-shot. With one swift movement, the Sensei strikes both Richard and Ben, elbowing Ben in the gut and kicking Richard in the chest.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nAnd he kicked all of our asses six ways from Sunday.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up shot of Ben. The shot is tinted red, blood spattering from Ben’s lips as the Sensei’s hand backhands him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nNinety seconds of survival. Ninety seconds of pure Hell.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nA similar shot as panel three, except of Richard.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nBen and I, we weren’t even fighting to win. We were just trying to endure.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of the Sensei in a wide side stance, sword out behind his head.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nBut.. what about Shiva?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nShiva. Yeah.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nShiva was…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium group shot. Ben and Richard both lie on the ground, trying to push themselves up, while Shiva and the Sensei square off.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nWe were a team, you know. Me, Ben, Shiva. We were all some of the greatest martial artists in the world. All trained by the same master. All about the same level. Or at least, that’s how it was, before that night. But when it came down to it, when it was time to rise to the challenge, or fall… two of us fell.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva and the Sensei rush at each other, swords raised.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nAnd one of us rose.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva knocks the Sensei’s blade aside with the flat of her own, lunging towards his chest.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium two-shot. For the first time in this entire series, Lady Shiva is astonished, surprise written across her face. In her hand, she holds the hilt of a blade, shattered by the hilt of the Sensei’s.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva rocks back on her heels, too slow to avoid a spinning kick across her jaw.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva attempts to block the Sensei’s follow-up knifehand. She misses, her guard too low to intercept it, but notably better than before.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nSensei taught her.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ELEVEN*\nMedium two-shot. The Sensei leaps through the air, bringing his heel down towards Shiva in an axe kick, which she blocks successfully, stance low and arms high.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nYes. You’re right. He didn’t mean to, I’m sure. But it was his nature. He couldn’t help but teach. And she couldn’t help but learn.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWELVE*\nClose-up of Shiva. Fierce. Determined. Having the _time of her life_.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nLook. Rich and I, we always knew Shiva had a dark side. She had a lust for danger. Finding it. _Being_ it. But before that fight, she was our friend. Before that fight, she could be beaten. Before that fight, she was still _human_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THIRTEEN*\nClose-up on Shiva as the Sensei’s sword draws a line of blood across her cheek.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nStill can. Still _is_.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nI hope to God you’re right. But what she did to win that fight...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOURTEEN*\nMedium action shot. Richard lunges to his feet, rushing towards the Sensei, who seems distracted with Shiva.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIFTEEN*\nMedium shot. The Sensei, with an easy movement, kicks Richard’s knee. The joint visibly shatters, bending in a way it was clearly never meant to.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nSFX: YEAAAAGH!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIXTEEN*\nMedium group shot. Richard lies on the ground, clutching his leg, face contorted in pain. His dragon aura sputters out of existence around him. Behind him, Ben tries to come to the aid of his friends, but is dispatched before he can even fully stand by a fist to the forehead.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVENTEEN*\nShot of Shiva. She’s watching the scene, doing nothing. Observing. Learning.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHTEEN*\nMedium shot. Richard is still lying on the ground, the Sensei above him, but this time there’s a sword through his gut, low, central enough that it’s got to have at least nicked the spine.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\n… oh.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nYeah.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINETEEN*\nMedium shot. The Sensei stands over Richard, bloodied sword above his head, poised for the final blow. We see the silhouette of Shiva in the foreground.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWENTY*\nShiva moves in towards the Sensei, swift but not rushed, elbow striking him square in the solar plexus. His sword falls from his hand.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWENTY-ONE*\nShiva follows up with a reverse punch, straight into the Sensei’s gut.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWENTY-TWO*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva brings her leg down in an axe kick. The Sensei blocks it, but he’s visibly tiring now, sweat beading on his forehead.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWENTY-THREE*\nClose-up of a hand, wrapping around the hilt of the Sensei’s sword. Its skin is smooth, young and unwrinkled.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nDon’t take this the wrong way. But the moment you turned up, all I could think was… God. How Shiva must _hate_ you.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nBecause… don’t kill?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWENTY-FOUR*\nFull-body shot of Shiva, legs spread in a side stance, sword raised behind her head. A perfect mirror of panel four.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nYes, and no. Because Shiva's sacrificed everything that made her human, just to have what you have. And now that you have it… all you want is everything she gave up.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOUR**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nBack to the present. A close-up shot of CASSANDRA CAIN, mask off, as she looks down in contemplation.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\n… did she… win?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up shot of Ben. His expression is neutral, not quite answering the question.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (VO)\nIt was _damn_ close. But she made it. 103 seconds. I counted every one of them. But when he knew he’d had it, he turned tail and ran. Fled the scene.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Cass, frowning.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (VO)\nNot… same as… _beating_ him.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Richard. His eyes are sad.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nNo. It’s not.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nFlashback shot. Shiva, Ben and Richard are now alone in the Temple. Shiva tends to Richard, who lies on the ground, while Ben sits beside him, nursing his own wounds.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nTry to imagine how your mother took _that_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium two-shot of Shiva and Richard. Richard looks numb and tired, while Shiva is her usual brusque self.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nYour knee has been badly shattered, and you have suffered nerve damage. Even with my aid, it will require two, perhaps three years of intensive physical training to restore functionality.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up. Richard gives Shiva a level stare, not quite masking a combination of betrayal and concern. He wants nothing to do with this path Shiva is walking.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\n… if it’s all the same to you, Shiva… I think this might be the universe telling me that it’s time to retire.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up of Shiva, lips pressed together in disappointment.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nHm. Pity.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nShiva stands, sword sheathed on her back as she stares into the distance, contemplative.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI think I _would_ like to teach.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nShe disappeared that night. Didn’t even say goodbye. The next we heard of her, she’d joined forces with Ra’s. The next we heard of her... _she_ was the new Sensei.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIVE**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nGroup shot, back to the present. Richard, Ben and Cass all trek through the halls of the same temple as the opening scene. Richard trails behind, one hand against the wall to support him, while Cass still has his folded wheelchair slung over her back.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION CAPTION\nNepal. An ancient Dhaulagiri temple. Now.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nSure… she's here?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nBetter hope she is. No way to get into the sanctuary without her.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium two-shot of Richard and Ben as they go down the hall. Richard is grinning mischievously, while Ben scowls.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nI don't know. I bet we could make one of the guards talk.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nC'mon, Rich. You know there's no way that the Sensei lets anyone into his private chambers. Even if the Savage Pit hasn’t recharged yet, they could poison it, or --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on Richard, still grinning.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYou’re losing your sense of humor, Ben.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Ben, who looks away.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nSorry. Just...  this entire thing’s making me jumpy. Chapter of my life I thought I’d closed years ago.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up. Richard shakes his head and waves his free hand.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nNo, it’s okay. I understand. And you’re right. She’ll be here.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up as Ben looks over his shoulder.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nIn fact, unless I miss my guess…\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA (OFFSCREEN)\nMy daughter’s foolishness is hardly surprising--\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIX**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFull body shot of LADY SHIVA, standing behind the group. She looks distinctly irritated.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nBut I expected better from the two of _you_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of Richard, who’s grinning again.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nReally? Why?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Ben, his arms folded.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nWe’re not leaving, Shiva. This is as personal for us as it is for you, and you know it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva looks at Cass, who also has her arms folded\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nLeave.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nNo.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Shiva, her eyes narrowed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nYou have no place in this, nor any concept of its history. _Leave._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Cass, one eyebrow raised in challenge.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nTrue. Wasn’t… born yet. Not for… nine months?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium two-shot. Cass and Shiva stare at each other, neither willing to budge.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up on Shiva, eyes narrowed and lip curled.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI have tried many times, Cassandra, to teach you not to interfere with that which does not concern you. If I am fortunate, you will finally learn it tonight. If you are *un*fortunate, you will learn it too _well._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nMedium shot. Shiva presses a stone on the wall, opening a hidden door.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nFollow. We will not talk here.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVEN**\nSeven panels, one full-width, one row of two, one row of three, and another full-width. The panels themselves are slanted, sloping downwards like the spiralling passages of a catacomb.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nThe four figures wend their way through an ancient-looking, poorly lit stone passageway. Shiva leads the way, Ben and Cass behind her, and Richard, using his wheelchair again now that they’re back on flat ground, trails at the back.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nSo what's the plan, Shiva?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nThe plan is twofold. First, we must destroy the Savage Pit, in order to ensure it may not be used again. Second, we must destroy the Sensei himself.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nNo killing.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nDid you come here to stop the Sensei, Cassandra? Or are you here purely to enforce your childish demands?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Cass, eyes hard. She’s not arguing this.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\n_No killing._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMirrored shot of Shiva. She’s got the same expression.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nThen I suggest we split up.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nWide group shot. Shiva continues to walk down the passage, ahead of the other three, gesturing with an arm.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI alone know the means to destroy the Pit. Richard and I will seek it out. You and Benjamin may seek out the Sensei's chambers. Certainly, he will be in one of these areas. If I find him, I will deal with him as _I_ wish.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nAnd if we find him?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nThen perhaps Cassandra will _learn_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot. Ben moves ahead, walking next to Shiva, who continues without looking behind her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nShiva, you sure about this? We're all ass-kickers, but the Sensei beat us like a drum _before_ the Savage Pit. It might take all four of us to take him down, if that --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nIf you fear to face him again, Benjamin, my advice is simple:\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\n_Don’t_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium two-shot, except now it’s Cass who’s running after Shiva. The older woman is starting to look irritated again. In the background, we can see the figures of Richard and Ben, Ben bent down to hear better as they whisper to each other.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nMom--\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nYou have tried my patience enough today, Cassandra. *Go.*\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nWide shot. The group splits into two to go down separate paths of the catacomb, Ben and Cass to the right, Shiva and Richard to the left. Cass trails slightly behind Ben, looking over her shoulder, visibly unsure. Shiva does not look back at all.\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHT**\nSeven panels, one row of three and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Ben and Cass walk through a passage not unlike the one they just left, worn stone and flickering torches. Cass leads, holding a flashlight to help further light their way.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (VO)\nShe’s an interesting one, you know. Cassandra.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva and Richard are in a similar-looking tunnel, ground still flat enough for Richard to use his chair. Shiva looks back towards Richard, just enough to see him in the corner of her eye. Richard looks straight at her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nShe is not yours. \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nI know.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot. Ben has a hand on Cass’s shoulder, stopping her before she rounds a corner.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nStill. It’s strange to see. Just as headstrong as you are, but a whole lot gentler.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nShe is not _gentle_. She is _soft_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Shiva, staring ahead of her determinedly.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nYou think I do not know the difference. I do. She is naïve and reactionary. Her _philosophy_ is the shallow self-comfort of a wounded child. She will crumble at the first true challenge to it. She will only be cut by the world.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot. Richard’s eyes bore  into the back of Shiva’s head.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYou don’t think you might be projecting?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nYou believe I see my own defeats, Richard?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nI believe you see _Carolyn_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Shiva. Tiny pupils, eyes wide, lips pursed. Shock and fury.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (OFFSCREEN)\nYou know, I used to wonder what price you paid, to join the League. And now I know. You gave a child to the man who murdered your sister. All in pursuit of _perfection_. So _now_, I wonder...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up on Richard. His eyes are intense now, cold and piercing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nWhat _else_ are you willing to do?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINE**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide two-shot. Shiva has now whipped around, staring at Richard like she could murder him with her eyes alone. Richard stares back up at her, no hesitation as he meets her gaze.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nGet to the point, Dragon.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nFine. The one thing I can’t figure out is… how do you intend to recharge it?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Shiva. Her eyes are wide, but this time there’s no fury in her reaction, only surprise.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD (OFFSCREEN)\nYou’re _not_ going to make me say it, are you? You’re planning to use the Savage Pit for yourself. That’s why you went off the grid. That’s why you suggested we split up. Let me guess. I was going to mysteriously fall behind after the first set of guards we found, right?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on Shiva. She’s staring at Richard, thinking.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nSame shot as Panel Three, except Shiva’s eyes have slid to the side and downward, breaking eye contact.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nWhat the Pits may give, they may also take. The life force of another may restore it, if used properly.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Richard, who just looks… exasperated.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nChrist. Really? So what was the plan here? Sacrifice the Sensei’s guards until you powered it up? Or, no, worse than that. It needs to be the Sensei himself, doesn’t it? You actually think you can just beat him _first_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium two-shot. Richard sits with his arms folded, still looking up at Shiva, who stands across from him doing the same.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nBut if that’s the case, why do it _now_? I know you, Shiva. You _hate_ the Lazarus Pits. I thought you'd _never_ pollute your body like that.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI have not been sitting idly these past weeks, Richard. My clandestine purpose has been _research_, and I have finally unlocked the ritual I sought. When I enter the Pit, I will not only take its knowledge as my own; I will drain it dry. None will follow in my footsteps.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium two-shot. Both figures have unfolded their arms now, hands gesturing as they speak.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYou don’t need to do this. There are better ways to neutralize it.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI cannot allow that knowledge to be lost! No more than I can allow the Sensei to use it for his own ends.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up on Richard, head tilted upwards. Not desperate, but still pleading.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nIt’s not worth it! Whatever walks out of that Pit, it won’t be you anymore.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nSame shot as Panel Eight, except Richard’s expression is different, almost accusing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nUnless… God help me, is that the _point_? Just another in a long line of ways to destroy Sandra Wu-San so you don’t have to deal with --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA (OFFSCREEN)\n_Enough._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TEN**\nFive panels, two rows of two and one full-width. Panel one is twice the width of panel two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide two-shot. Shiva begins to walk away from Richard, but he grabs her wrist, stopping her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nYou have never understood my motives. Do not think you will begin now.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nI know you enjoy being inscrutable, Shiva. But I’ve always understood more than you think.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Shiva, glaring down. Murder in her gaze.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nI warned you once, Richard, of the consequences of standing in my way. I will not warn you again.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of Richard. He’s no longer looking at Shiva, instead staring down as he LAUGHS.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nSFX: HEH\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYou know… I guess I always knew this day would come. That we always _both_ knew.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nExtreme close-up. Richard’s hand touches his DRAGON FANG NECKLACE, glowing a faint yellow.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nOkay, Sandra.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nFull-body shot. Richard stands now, chair behind him, Dragon aura flaring around him. His eyes are hard, and his expression is completely determined, showing no hint of pain.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nOne last time.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot, back to Ben and Cass. It’s the same shot as where we left them, Ben grabbing Cass’s shoulder as she looks back at him.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\nWhat is it?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN\nLook down.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up of the passage floor. Visible in the dust and dirt is a clear set of footprints.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (OFFSCREEN)\nThose are fresh. We’re not alone.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS (OFFSCREEN)\nYou think… Sensei?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nBEN (OFFSCREEN)\nHard to say. Keep sharp.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. We see Cass and Ben peering cautiously around the corner, looking behind the viewer.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nPOV shot. Around the corner, we see a large room. Once, it was probably a meditation chamber, but now, repurposed as a living area, and a lavishly decorated one at that. The Sensei’s quarters. Inside are a group of five ASSASSINS, each armed with a ceremonial sword. The personal guard. Conservation of ninjutsu may be assumed to apply here.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on the assassins, faces reacting with surprise and hostility. Our heroes would seem to have been spotted.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Cass and Ben, both reacting in alarm. Our heroes would seem to have realized this, too.\n:::\n\n**PAGES TWELVE AND THIRTEEN**\n24 panels, four rows of six arranged as a two-page spread.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva leaps towards Richard with a flying side kick, which he deflects with an arm. His stance is low, rooted… he’s not going anywhere.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nYou used the same move the first time we met, Shiva. Feeling _nostalgic?_\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. Shiva lands, sword raised in front of her, eyes narrowed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\n_Hardly._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nRichard dodges backwards, only the upper half of his body bending, as he avoids a sword slash across his chest.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nShame. _I_ am.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nRichard ducks low, folding forward as a hail of throwing stars sails over his head.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nCain had set us all up against each other. Murdered Carolyn and framed _me_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nRichard is knocked backwards by a boot under his chin.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRICHARD\nThe moment I saw you, I knew two things.

Back to Ben and Cass versus the Guards. Guard Four hits the ground, unconscious, nose shattered and face bloodied.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWENTY*\nMedium shot of Cass, low angle.

Panel seven is twice the width of panel eight.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva stands over Richard, sword to his throat. Not, in fact, at all unlike Panel Nineteen of the Pages Two and Three two-page spread. We can see his face from this angle. He just looks resigned.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Shiva, low angle. For the first time that we’ve seen her, she looks… hesitant.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nRichard…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Shiva lowers the sword, turning her head to the side.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nGet up.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Richard, lying on the floor.

But I always thought it’d end with --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. Richard gasps in shock and pain as a SWORD erupts from his chest. He’s been stabbed from behind.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nFull-body shot of a shirtless Asian man, standing over Richard’s fallen form, blood dripping from his sword. He looks young, perhaps in his 20s or 30s, with a full head full of short greenish-black hair, and he looks in good condition, corded muscles under smooth skin. His eyes are wild, and a vivid, almost glowing green. We saw him last issue. We saw him on the first page, too, but not as he is now. It’s THE SENSEI.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up on Shiva’s face. Her eyes are wide with shock.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\n***RICHARD!***\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nFour panels, stacked.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot of the Sensei.

Ever the instructor.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSENSEI\nAnd so we have come full-circle.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on Shiva’s face. There are no tears, but her expression is pure murder, and unrestrained fury at that. She looks _devastated._\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSENSEI (OFFSCREEN)\nNothing to say for the occasion?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSENSEI (OFFSCREEN)\nYou always _were_ a woman of few words.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on the Sensei.

This will be a fair test of skills.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Shiva’s eyes, hard and narrowed. There is no sign of her doubt, her pain, her rage. She’s ready to kill.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\n_Good._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGES SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN**\nEighteen panels, arranged as three rows of six in a two-page spread.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFull-body shot of the Sensei, rushing forward with his sword raised. The art here should give a sense of almost humanly impossible speed, the background a blurred green.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium two-shot. Shiva deflects Sensei’s blade with the flat of her sword, stepping back as she does so.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nSame as panel two, except that Shiva is deflecting the blade to the other side. Still taking a step backwards.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nShiva lunges towards the Sensei with her weapon.

The sword’s motion is arrested successfully, but the Sensei grabs her wrist with his other hand.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWELVE*\nThe Sensei jerks Shiva’s arm backwards, visibly dislocating the shoulder.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSHIVA\nSFX: AUGH!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THIRTEEN*\nShiva turns on a heel, sweeping the Sensei back with a high kick.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOURTEEN*\nThe Sensei ducks under Shiva’s kick, slashing at her face with his sword. He draws a line of blood across her cheek.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIFTEEN*\nThe Sensei brings the hilt of his sword down on the crown of Shiva’s head, driving her into the ground. Her sword goes flying.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIXTEEN*\nMedium two-shot. Sensei stands over Shiva, sword at her throat. She stares up at him, defiant, half-kneeling, clutching her wounded arm.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSENSEI\n_This_ is the greatest that the legendary Lady Shiva has to offer?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVENTEEN*\nThe Sensei turns his head, sword still at Shiva’s throat, as a voice comes from offscreen.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nVOICE (OFFSCREEN)\nNo.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHTEEN*\nWide two-shot. The Sensei staggers, struck by a flying kick to the side of his head. The one delivering it is in the air beside him, form perfect, arms raised. It’s Cassandra Cain. Fans of Richard Dragon: Kung-Fu Fighter will recognize the framing.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nCASS\n_I_ am.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGES EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN**\nTwenty-four panels, as four rows of six, arranged as a two-page spread.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot.

The Sensei backflips out of range of either woman, wiping blood from his mouth.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWELVE*\nThe Sensei glances at something offscreen.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THIRTEEN*\nPOV shot.

The Sensei flees.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium three-shot.

Wide panel. An Old West-type town. Lots of wooden buildings and dirt roads. There’s a mountain range with sparse vegetation in the background and a hanging sign that reads \"WELCOME TO SALVATION VALLEY!\" at the front. There's even a tumbleweed blowing in the breeze.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: Salvation Valley. It’s not big, it’s not fancy, and we’re lucky if we get any visitors *at all,* but it’s home.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: Well, maybe not *my* home, but still...\n\nPanel 2. The inside of a building. REGINA TAYLOR (15, African-American, dressed “boyishly”) is stocking a cabinet full of medical supplies. She’s talking to someone off-panel. There’s a wry grin on her face.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: I shouldn’t complain. I’m *very* lucky (I have to remind myself every morning).\n\nREGINA\nReady to start the day, Doc?\n\nDOC (O.S.)\nHrmph!\n\nREGINA\nThat's the spirit!\n\nPanel 3. Outside a mine. There are some WORKERS milling about, wiping sweat from their brows, pushing carts, laughing at unheard jokes. The workers are *very* diverse (ANIMAL MEN, HUMANS, ROBOTS, MUNCHKINLANDERS, etc). We see Regina handing out some lanterns to the workers. She still looks like she’s having a good time.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: The people who live here...they didn’t *have* to take me in. They don’t have to be so nice to me every day.\n\nREGINA\nNew shipment just arrived today! Got some explosives, too, if you’re serious about expanding the western tunnel.\n\nWORKER #1\nWe’re gonna have to. All the veins have been tapped dry!\n\nREGINA\nI’ll get some crates together when I get back.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: (Mind knows I’ve been to plenty of places that *weren’t*).\n\nPanel 4. The inside of a church. It's *very* pristine and clean. Regina is sitting in the front row. She looks…*uncomfortable.* On a raised platform is a CROCODILE-MAN DRESSED IN HOLY ROBES with his arms raised. We can see some OTHER CHURCHGOERS in the visible pews as well, and--like with the mine--it’s a *very* diverse group. Behind Regina we can see a stained glass window depicting a human hand holding a black lightning bolt.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: It’s not like I *believed* in the same ideas my parents did...\n\nCROCODILE-PRIEST\n...And lo, the Great Mind did look upon the disparate lands of magic, upon their savagery and madness, and saw that He might bring them together, that they might know love under His watchful eye!\n\nPanel 5. The inside of a schoolhouse. Once again, Regina is sitting in front. A YOUNG BOY at the front is reading a paper to her and the OTHER STUDENTS. Regina looks *angry.*\n\nREGINA [CAP]: It’s just I’ve learned it’s best *not* to tell people where I come from.\n\nYOUNG BOY\n...And the Great Mind shut down the Gamelands, and the captured traitors were sentenced to death!\n \nTEACHER (O.S.)\nVery good. Lily, will you please come up and give your report on the Flooding of the Funlands?\n\nPanel 6. Wide panel. The inside of a saloon. PATRONS are either sitting at the bar, playing cards, or just milling about. A FLYING MONKEY is playing piano on the left. Behind the bar is MINERVA (40s, all white-hair, black-and-white dress). She's talking to Regina. Regina's carrying a large box of supplies. She seems more relaxed.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: Don’t get me wrong I have a good life here. I *am* happy. It’s just...\n\nSFX: Music notes coming from the piano.\n\nREGINA\nWhere'd you want these, Miss Minerva?\n\nREGINA [CAP]: ...I dunno. I guess I just keep expecting something to happen. To *change.*\n\nMINERVA\nJust put them in the back with the rest, Regina. Thank you!\n\nREGINA [CAP]: But nothing ever--\n\n**PAGE TWO - FOUR PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Wide panel. The saloon QUAKES. Everyone is either ducking for cover, holding on to their winnings, or standing completely still. The windows have all CRACKED!\n\nSFX: WHHHHAAAAAAAMMM!!!\n\nPanel 2. Wide panel. The quaking has stopped. The patrons are getting out of their seats and heading for the doors. Minerva is following behind, carrying a large, futuristic rifle.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: Nothing...nothing ever...\n\nPanel 3. Wide panel. Minerva is standing outside the saloon. Her patrons are all poking their heads through the door frame or peering through the windows. Everyone looks stunned.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: *What* the--?\n\nUNKNOWN (O.S.)\nUm, hi!\n\nPanel 4. Wide panel. Pull out. We can see something LARGE AND METALLIC lying in front of the saloon. Smoke is rising from...*whatever* it is.\n\nUNKNOWN (O.S.)\nSorry for disturbing you!\n(whisper)\nAnd also for, um...wrecking your stuff...\n\n**PAGE THREE - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Large panel. The head of MISTER ATOM (giant, blue-and-yellow robot) is lying in a crater in the middle of the street, his eyes black and empty. We can see a building behind Atom with a hole in the roof. Standing on top of the head are TAWKY TAWNY (large tiger, fur covered in oil, riding harness with a lightning bolt on the front) and BILLY BATSON (15, tattered clothing, dirt and soot all over his body).\n\nBILLY\nBut is there a doctor here?\n\n**Title: \"Shazam the Barbarian, Chapter I: *Showdown at Salvation Valley!*\"**\n\nPanel 2. Billy has jumped to the ground. He's walking towards the patrons confidently. Excitedly! Energetic--\n\nPanel 3. --Billy hits the ground, face first. Tawny has landed next to him.\n\nPanel 4. Tawny sniffs Billy. No movement.\n\nPanel 5. Tawny looks in the direction of the patrons, giving the biggest \"sad eyes\" ever seen.\n\nTAWNY\nMeowr?\n\nPanel 6. Wide panel. Back with the patrons. Everyone is staring at Minerva. Minerva just looks...*annoyed.* We can see Regina is already half-way off-screen.\n\nMINERVA\n(sigh)\nRegina, go fetch Doc.\n\nREGINA\n'Kay!\n\nMINERVA\nAnd nobody steal 'til I get back!\n\nALL PATRONS\n'Kay!\n\n**PAGE FOUR - SEVEN PANELS**\n \nPanel 1. Thin panel. The outside of a building with a sign reading “DOCTOR OF MEDICINE, FIRST AND LAST AID GIVEN” on top. The sign has been painted in exact, precise lettering.\n\nCaption: LATER.\n\nPanel 2. Billy lying on a cot. There's wooden floorboards underneath. His shirt has been removed, a large white patch on his side. He's still unconscious\n\nPanel 3. Wide panel. A long hall made of white marble with black, pulsating veins running all over. Against the wall are SEVEN COLORED STATUES with the words \"THE SEVEN SACRED VIRTUES\" carved above them. Beneath each statue is a plaque listing their identities: PRUDENCE (yellow), DILIGENCE (blue), KINDNESS (green), TEMPERANCE (white), JUSTICE (red), CHARITY (orange), and HUMILITY (purple). The edges of this panel (and the next two) are *fuzzy.* Dreamlike.\n\nPanel 4. The end of the hall. There is a single throne composed of elk antlers. Standing in front of the throne are DR. THADDEUS SIVANA (40s, withered body, lightning bolt scar across one eye) and MR. MIND (green-and-black worm, voice box around his neck). Sivana is holding a long staff with a black lightning bolt on top. There are two torches on the wall, casting both figures in an eerie, pallid glow.\n\nPanel 5. SHAZAM (New 52 costume) standing in the same hall as everything else. *Black* lightning is dancing all around him. His hand is outstretched, his mouth contorted in a wordless scream--\n\nPanel 6. --Billy wakes up. Little sparks of electricity (normal color) CRACKLE in the center of his eyes.\n\nBILLY\n*Gasp!*\n\nPanel 7. Billy looking off to the side. He seems surprised.\n\nDOC (O.S.)\nEasy, easy now!\n\n**PAGE FIVE - SEVEN PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Billy's POV: DOC RABBIT--a well-dressed brown rabbit with tiny glasses and a white patch of fur beneath his nose in the shape of a *glorious* mustache--is sitting on a stool in front of him.\n\nDOC RABBIT\nYour body's been through *quite* the ordeal! You need to rest!\n\nPanel 2. Focus on Billy. He's clearly staring at Doc.\n\nBILLY\nYeah...okay...\n\nMINERVA (O.S.)\nChalk up another miracle for Doc Rabbit.\n\nPanel 3. Wide panel. View of Billy from the side. Across from him and Doc are Tawny (now clean, head poking through an open window), Regina (playfully scratching beneath Tawny’s chin) and Minerva (arms folded, rifle slung over her shoulder). Throughout the room, we can make out cabinets full of medical supplies, plus a few extra, empty beds.\n\nMINERVA\nGuess I’m gonna need to pay him after all...\n\nREGINA\nYou’re awake? Good! Your friend here was starting to worry!\n\nTAWNY\nMeowr!\n\nREGINA\nOh, yes you were, you big softy!\n\nTAWNY\nPurrrr....\n\nDOC RABBIT\nHe almost didn't wake up at all!\n\nPanel 4. Close in on Doc and Billy. Doc is still working on the stitches. Billy is wincing.\n\nSFX: POKE!\n\nBILLY\nOw!\n\nDOC RABBIT\nHonestly, these injuries! Do you have any idea *how* close you came to--\n\nPanel 5. Regina has placed a hand on Doc's shoulder. She's giving him a half-smile. Doc looks irritated.\n\nREGINA\n--Now, Doc, what did we discuss about your bedside manner?\n\nDOC RABBIT\n(sigh)\n*Not* to emphasize how close the patients are to dying...or all the myriad ways they *could* die...\n\nREGINA\nAaaand? What *else?*\n\nDOC RABBIT\nHuh? Oh, right.\n\nPanel 6. Doc is smiling in Billy's direction. It's...*unnerving.*\n\nPanel 7. Focus on Billy. He looks just as uncomfortable as we are.\n\nBILLY\n...Thanks...?\n\nMINERVA (O.S.)\nOh, don't mind him!\n\n**PAGE SIX - FIVE PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Wide panel. Minerva is sitting on the foot of the bed. Billy has his legs raised to give her room. The two are shaking hands. In the background, Doc is walking towards one of his cabinets. Tawny is watching him go, licking his lips.\n\nMINERVA\nDoc's only surly when he's in a *good* mood.\n(beat)\nFolks here call me Minerva. Bartender, sheriff, and closest thing this dirt-poor backwater has to a Mayor.\n\nBILLY\nBilly Batson. Hobo child.\n\nPanel 2. Focus on Billy. He has a surprised look on his face.\n\nMINERVA (O.S.)\nPleasure.\n\nSFX: *Click!*\n\nPanel 3. Pull back out. Billy's arm has been handcuffed to one of the bars underneath the cot. Minerva is lighting a cigarette. Billy’s trying to jiggle his hand free.\n\nSFX: *CLINK! CLINK!*\n\nBILLY\nHey! What are you--?\n\nMINERVA\n--Told you: I'm the sheriff, and I got some questions.\n\nPanel 4. Wide panel. Minerva is blowing smoke in Billy’s direction. Billy is using his free hand to cover his mouth and nose. In the background, Doc is rummaging through a cabinet, while Tawny is stretching his neck towards him, drooling. Regina has turned in their direction.\n\nSFX: Exclamation mark above Regina's head.\n\nMINERVA\nLook, it’s not like I *enjoy* being so direct--*especially* since you're still recovering--but there's a giant robot head in the middle of my street, and I'd *very* much like an explanation.\n\nBILLY\nRight...that…\n*cough* *cough*\nWould you believe he started it…?\n\nMINERVA\nActually, *yes.*\n\nPanel 5. Wide panel. Minerva is holding her cigarette out to the side. Billy has lowered his free hand. In the background, Regina has turned Tawny's head away from Doc. Tawny’s eyes are wide and his ears are pulled back.\n\nMINERVA\nWe've all heard the stories of Mister Atom: the mad mecha rampaging across the desert, attacking pilgrim and scoundrel alike. I'm certain that, whatever happened, he, \"started it.\"\n\nBILLY\nOh, good, then we can--\n\nMINERVA\n--*My* issue, Mr. Batson, is that *I'm* the one responsible for keeping everyone *safe*. It's the first law of Monster World:\n\n**PAGE SEVEN - SEVEN PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Focus on Minerva. She's giving an intense stare in Billy’s direction.\n\nMINERVA\n\"And the crocodile will eat the lamb, and not one tear shall be shed. For the strong survive, and the weak shall be dead.\"\n(beat)\nI have a *lot* of lambs in this town, Mr. Batson...\n\nPanel 2. Focus on Billy. He's uncomfortable.\n\nMINERVA (O.S.)\n...Which are *you?*\n\nBILLY\nThat’s...complicated...\n\nPanel 3. Wide panel. Minerva is standing up. Doc has returned to the bed, pouring some medicine into a spoon and giving Minerva an irritated look. Billy is still handcuffed to the bed frame. In the back, Regina is giving Tawny a *very* disapproving finger. Tawny is giving her an equally sour face.\n\nDOC RABBIT\n*Excuse me,* Miss Minerva, but my patient needs his rest now. I think it’s best if you *all* took your leave.\n\nMINERVA\nFine with me, Doc. Not like he's going anywhere soon!\n\nREGINA\n*No* eating doctors!\n\nTAWNY\n(small text)\nMew...\n\nMINERVA\nI’ll see about bringing him some food. And maybe a new shirt.\n\nPanel 4. Minerva and Regina both leaving through the now-opened door. The two are looking at each other, Minerva appearing amused while Regina is *red* in the face. Through the window, we can see Tawny following them both.\n\nMINERVA\nUnless you’d *like* to stay with the boy a little bit *longer,* Regina?\n\nREGINA\n*Ma'am!*\n\nMINERVA\nHa!\n\nPanel 5. Doc is raising the spoon of medicine towards Billy's mouth, standing on his tiptoes.\n\nSFX: *Ka-click!* (over where door would be)\n\nDOC RABBIT\nSay \"ah!\"\n\nBILLY\nAhhh!\n\nDOC RABBIT\nSo, is there anyone you would like us to contact? We have a scrying pool.\n\nPanel 6. Focus on Billy. He's looking off in the distance.\n\nDOC RABBIT (O.S.)\n\nWe could let your family know you’re here.\n\nBILLY\nNo--thank you!--but...that won’t be necessary..\n\nPanel 7. Shot of Salvation Valley from above. Mister Atom’s head is still in its crater. Half the town is covered by shadow. A LARGE DUST CLOUD is heading towards the entrance.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: It’s just me.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT - EIGHT PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Thin panel. Ground level, facing the dust cloud. We can see FIVE DARK FIGURES inside.\n\nPanel 2. Small panel. The front of a black-and-silver hoverbike. There’s a skull welded to the front.\n\nPanel 3. Small panel. A GRAY HAND wearing a fingerless black glove. It REVS the handles.\n\nSFX: VROOOM! VROOOM!\n\nPanel 4. Small panel. The back of the hoverbike. A *large* pair of speakers.\n\nSFX: *BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!*\n\nPanel 5. Small panel. A GRAY MOUTH with a black beard. It’s grinning, displaying two rows of sharpened teeth.\n\nPanel 6. The \"WELCOME\" sign outside town. We see the back of the hoverbike.A GRAY ARM reaches out from the hoverbike and SMACKS the sign.\n\nSFX: SMACK!\n\nPanel 7. The sign hits the ground, split in half. We can make out FOUR OTHER HOVERBIKES passing by it.\n\nSFX: CRACK!\n\nPanel 8. Wide panel. We see the riders from the front. Left to right they are: JOHNNY QUIETUS (gray-skinned and lanky, dressed like an undertaker), BLUDHOUND (bronze skin, unkempt red hair and beard), LOBO (gray skin, red eyes, black facial markings straight out of a KISS cover band), JONAS GLIM (pig-like humanoid, two tusks jutting from his mouth) and BILLY THE GIRL (red-skinned humanoid, wearing a trench coat, bulletproof-vest and camo pants).\n\n**PAGE NINE - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Lobo and his gang driving down the main road. We see Tawny’s silhouette lying on someone’s porch, head raised and watching them go.\n\nLOBO\nWa-hooo!\n\nSFX: Laughter.\n\nPanel 2. Lobo and his crew parking their bikes outside the saloon. Lobo is stretching. Billy and Jonas are staring at the head of Mister Atom in horror.\n\nJONAS\nLobo! Lobo! He got Atom!\n\nLOBO\nI seen it!\n\nPanel 3. Lobo SNIFFING the air. He seems deep in thought.\n\nSFX: SNIFF! SNIFF!\n\nLOBO\nSomethin’ aint ri--\n\nPanel 4. Lobo looking to his left. Irritated.\n\nBLUDHOUND (O.S.)\n--Hey, boss!\n\nPanel 5. We see Bludhound standing next to Lobo’s bike. There's SOMETHING LARGE attached to the chain on the end. Whatever it is, it's covered by a black tarp and lying in the dirt. There’s a long dirt trail extending from off-panel and going all the way to Lobo’s bike, suggesting that--whatever it was--Lobo dragged it the entire drive. All we see of Lobo is the back of his head and shoulder.\n\nBLUDHOUND\nI think she's still *alive!*\n\nPanel 6. The tarp has been blown back. It’s CRUSH, Lobo's daughter (16, identical skin and markings to Lobo, but her eyes are normal). We're focused on her face. She's still lying in the dirt, heavily bruised with blood on her nose and lips. Bludhound’s boot is next to her head. Lobo is walking towards her.\n\nLOBO\nWell, no #$@%, dingus! She's got *my* healing factor!\n(lower)\nIt’s the *personality* what comes from her mother…\n\n**PAGE TEN - NINE PANEL GRID**\n\nPanel 1. Lobo pulling up Crush's head by her hair, staring down at her.\n\nLOBO\nSo, pumpkin, what did we learn..?\n\nPanel 2. Crush spits on Lobo.\n\nSFX: PFFT!\n\nPanel 3. Lobo throws Crush to the ground. We can't even see her anymore.\n\nLOBO\nNo, sweetie.\n\nPanel 4. Lobo's back is turned. He's kicking her.\n\nLOBO\nThe correct answer...is to not...let our targets...*go!*\n\nPanel 5. Crush on the ground, barely conscious. Lobo's kneeling over her.\n\nLOBO\nNow, Daddy’s gonna go get hisself a drink an’ relax. You just lie here an’ get some sun, ‘kay? And, maybe, while yer at it…\n\nPanel 6. Lobo’s face, covered in shadow. All we see are his two, red eyes.\n\nLOBO\nYou could try reflectin’ on what bein’ *soft* gets ya.\n\nPanel 7. Lobo and his crew are walking away, Crush still on the ground.\n\nPanel 8. Lobo and his crew are gone. Crush is all alone.\n\nPanel 9. Same as before.\n\nREGINA (O.S.)\nExcuse me, ma’am! I don't mean to cause any trouble--\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Crush is on her elbows, looking up. Regina is sitting next to her, Tawny behind them both. Tawny is *furious.*\n\nREGINA\n--But it looks like you could use some help.\n\nTAWNY\nGrrrr!\n\nMINERVA [CAP]: Bounty hunters, huh?\n\nPanel 2. Inside the saloon. Lobo is at the bar, downing a shot glass. Minerva is on the other side. In the background, we can see Lobo’s crew playing a game of pool.\n\nMINERVA\nNot sure how much help we can be to you, Mr...Lobo, was it? Don’t really get a lot of wanted criminals around these parts.\n\nPanel 3. Lobo is pointing at the empty shot glass. He is *not* pleased.\n\nLOBO\nYa call dis *booze?* Ya couldn’t even melt the shell off a snail with it!\n\nMINERVA\nYou want stronger drink, hun? I want stronger *pay.*\n\nLOBO\n(mumbling)\nRuddin’ laws of supply and demand...\n\nPanel 4. Lobo has placed a few extra coins on the bar. Minerva is pouring him a glowing, red drink, smiling. Lobo is touching his nose.\n\nMINERVA\nMuch obliged.\n(beat)\nSo! Who ya hunting?\n\nLOBO\nA real *scumbag.* High value target worth an #$@load of coin! Been tryin’ ta catch the #$%@^*& for a little over six months now. But no one escapes the Main Man’s nose!\n\nMINERVA\nUh-huh.\n\nPanel 5. Lobo is drinking the shot. Minerva is polishing some glasses, back to Lobo.\n\nMINERVA\nSo what’s his name?\n\nPanel 6. Focus on Minerva. She’s straightened up, eyes wide.\n\nLOBO (O.S.)\nBilly Batson.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Minerva has turned back around, completely calm. Lobo’s back is to us. He’s reaching for a piece of paper sticking out of his back pocket.\n\nMINERVA\nNever heard of him. Got a picture?\n\nLOBO\nSure do! Got it right ‘ere!\n\nPanel 2. A wanted poster. It’s recognizably a picture of Billy...only his features have been greatly exaggerated (demonic eyes, crooked ears, menacing smile with rows of fangs for teeth, etc). The panel cuts off just before we see what the offered reward is. We can see Lobo’s fingers on top of the poster.\n\nLOBO (O.S.)\nMonster World’s Most Wanted!\n\nPanel 3. Back with Lobo and Minerva, view from the side. Lobo is lighting a cigar.\n\nSFX: FLICK!\n\nMINERVA\nThat...is that amount *real?*\n\nLOBO\nNah. That was *last* month’s reward. They’ve added an extra zero since.\n\nPanel 4. Lobo blowing out a smoke plume in the shape of a skull. Minerva is still staring at the poster.\n\nMINERVA\nWhat in the Seven Realms did he *do?*\n\nLOBO\nDon’t know, don’t care. All I know is the Great Mind hisself wants the little @#$&^%!*, and I would *generously* appreciate any clues as ta his whereabouts.\n\nPanel 5. Focus on Minerva. She’s silent. It’s unclear *what* she’s thinking.\n\nPanel 6. Same as before.\n\nMINERVA\nNever seen him.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN - FIVE PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Pull back out. Minerva and Lobo at the bar. They’re both looking outside through a window on the left.\n\nMINERVA\nHowever, there *was* somebody riding a god---- tiger this morning. Dropped off the giant paperweight out front before heading out. Guy was running like a bat out of Hell.\n\nLOBO\nHuh. Ya don’t say…\n\nPanel 2. Lobo and Minerva are facing each other. Minerva is giving Lobo her best “friendly” smile and holding out a cigarette for him. Lobo looks pleased and is lighting it for her.\n\nMINERVA\nDo me a favor if you find him: beat the living tar outta him for ruining our streets.\n\nLOBO\nHA! Well, the Main Man ain’t exactly one for refusin’ violence...but would ya mind answerin’ just *one* more, tiny little question fer me?\n\nPanel 3. Wide panel. We’ve pulled back a little. We can clearly see Regina, Tawny and Crush outside through a window *on the right.* Crush’s chain has been cut off, a hacksaw in Regina’s hand. All three are staring back through the window with tiny exclamation points above their heads. Tawny’s eyes are darn near bulging out of their sockets. Lobo is pointing at them, Minerva following his finger.\n\nLOBO\nIs that the same tiger you mentioned earlier?\n\nPanel 4. Same as previous.\n\nPanel 5. Wide panel. A large, pink laser comes out from under the bar and slices *right through* Lobo. Minerva is facing Lobo, her stance suggesting she’s holding her rifle under the bar. Lobo has his hook-and-chain raised over his head.\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN - SEVEN PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Shadowed outline of Lobo’s body from the back. The laser has split him down the middle, turning his upper torso into a V-shape. We can see Minerva’s face through the opening.\n\nPanel 2. Lobo’s body falls over. Minerva is now holding her rifle over the bar. The muzzle is smoking.\n\nMINERVA\nAlright, we’re closing early! Grab your belongings and get--\n\nPanel 3. Minerva looks concerned. Lobo’s hand has sprung back up and is grabbing the bar.\n\nLOBO (O.S.)\nUgggghhhhh...\n\nPanel 4. Lobo’s body (still in shadows, still split open) gets back up. Minerva has gone pale.\n\nLOBO\nJust a sec!\n\nPanel 5. Lobo begins regenerating. We can see tendrils stretching from one end of his body to the other, pulling it back together like the universe’s most demented crochete.\n\nSFX: *SPLLTCHH!*\n\nPanel 6. Lobo is completely healed. Minerva is backing away in horror.\n\nLOBO\nOh yeah. *That’s* better!\n\nPanel 7. Lobo and his crew from the front. They all have bloodthirsty grins. Lobo’s shirt has been destroyed by the laser beam. He’s *jacked.*\n\nLOBO\nNow, about that boy...\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Wide panel. Outside the bar, sunset. We see CITIZENS being led out of the bar by Lobo’s crew. All the citizens are bound together by the same rope. We can even see the Crocodile-Priest from the church and Doc Rabbit among them.\n\nPanel 2. The citizens are all kneeling in front of Mister Atom’s head, Minerva in the center with a defiant expression. Billy and Johnny Quietus are patrolling with their guns outs. Lobo surveys, fresh cigar clenched between his teeth and the biggest grin you’ve ever seen on his face.\n\nLOBO\nThat’s it. In a nice, firing-squad approved row!\n\nJONAS (O.S.)\nBoss! Boss!\n\nPanel 2. Lobo turns around. We see Jonas holding a restrained Regina.\n\nJONAS\nI got this one! But Crush--\n\nLOBO\n--Ferget about her! She’ll be back later. She *always* is.\n\nPanel 3. Lobo holding Regina’s chin. She is terrified.\n\nLOBO\n*My* only concern is how many yokels we gotta shish kebab ‘fore the big dang hero arrives!\n\nPanel 4. Inside the medical building. Everything is dark and shadowed. We can see Billy lying on his side.\n\nLOBO (O.S.)\nBatson!!\n\nPanel 5. We close in on Billy. He’s lying on the bed, pale and grasping the patch on his side. Clearly *not* in a condition for going outside.\n\nLOBO (O.S.)\nI’m callin’ you out!\n\nPanel 6. Billy sits up.\n\nLOBO (O.S.)\nThese people were willin’ ta lie fer you…\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Billy’s hand.

I should hide. If I go out there...\n\nPanel 4. Close-in on Billy’s face, staring at us. He’s become determined.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: But here’s the thing--well, *three* things--you need to know about me.\n\nLOBO (O.S.)\nFive! Six!\n\nPanel 5. Billy’s hand. He’s reached the doorknob.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: I don’t run. I don’t quit.\n\nLOBO (O.S.)\nSeven! Eight!\n\nPanel 6. Billy’s opened the door. He’s a black silhouette outlined by the orange light.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: And I don’t leave anyone behind.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: My name is Billy Batson.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Billy outside the medical shack.

Billy is looking to his left. We can see Bludhound and a chained-up Tawny in the background.\n\nPanel 3. Close-in on Tawny. He’s clawing at the dirt, desperate to break free. Bludhound is having a hard time keeping him restrained.\n\nTAWNY\nRawr!!\n\nBLUDHOUND\nStupid cat...\n\nBILLY [CAP]: I know, buddy. I know.\n\nPanel 4.

Billy is standing directly across from Lobo now, the sun setting in the back.\n\nBILLY\nThere’s no need to make this any worse!\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN - EIGHT PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Billy’s back is to us. Lobo is directly across. They’re both positioned in a classic “High Noon draw” style.\n\nLOBO\n*HA!* Oh man, that is *rich!* I *love* this kid!\n\nPanel 2. The mirror reverse of Panel 1. Lobo’s back to us, Billy staring him down.\n\nLOBO\nLook, I dunno what it is you did that’s got the Great Mind all in a tizzy, but the Main Man don’t lose! He don’t quit! He don’t even *die!* Ya think *you* scare *me?*\n\nPanel 3. Focus on Billy’s face. He’s worried.\n\nBILLY\nIt’s not me you should be afraid of.\n\nPanel 4. Focus on Lobo.

His eyes wide in disbelief. There’s some lightning CRACKLING at the edge of the panel.\n\nPanel 2. Minerva, stunned. The Crocodile-Priest and Doc Rabbit are next to her, just as startled.\n\nMINERVA\n(whisper)\nGod----, kid. I was wrong about you...\n\nPanel 3. Regina, still pinned under Lobo’s boot. She’s just as shocked as everyone else. There’s more lightning CRACKLING all over the edge of the panel.\n\nREGINA\nNo way...\n\nPanel 4. Close in on Regina’s eye. We can see the outline of SOMEONE COVERED IN LIGHTNING reflected in the iris.\n\nMINERVA (O.S.)\nYou’re not a lamb or a crocodile.\n\nPanel 5. Billy Batson is gone. Standing in his place is an ADULT MALE with a full, salt-and-pepper beard and an unkempt head of similar-colored hair. On his chest is a red, sleeveless vest, the insides forming a lightning-bolt insignia. On his wrists are two golden bracers. His pants are a standard leather, with a pair of ragged traveler's boots on each foot. His belt is lopsided and plain. We can make out a white cloak on his back, but it’s in tatters, the hood clearly torn off. And hanging from a belt loop, violently spewing thunder, is a simple woodsman’s axe with a lightning bolt engraved into the blade. This, is SHAZAM THE BARBARIAN.\n\nMINERVA [CAP]: You’re a *demon.*\n\nSHAZAM\nAll right.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Close-in on Shazam’s face.

He’s looking just a little *too* please with himsel--\n\nPanel 2. --A fist comes out of nowhere and PUNCHES Shazam across the face!\n\nPanel 3. Pull out. Shazam is being attacked by Bludhound. Bludhound is wearing some sort of electric brass knuckles on each fist. He clearly *dwarves* Shazam in size.\n\nBLUDHOUND\nHeh! *Wuss!*\n\nPanel 4. Another punch across Shazam’s left!\n\nPanel 5. More punches to the abdomen!\n\nSFX: WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM!\n\nPanel 6. Shazam’s hands grabbing Bludhound’s.\n\nBLUDHOUND\nWhat the--?\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO - NINE PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Shazam turning around and lifting Bludhound up over his shoulder.\n\nPanel 2. Shazam TOSSES Bludhound over his shoulder and SLAMS him into the ground!

Shazam places the hilt of the axe on Bludhound’s chest.\n\nPanel 5. The exterior of Salvation Valley. A *massive* lightning bolt CAREENS from above and STRIKES the town.\n\nSFX: KRA-KOOOOOOM!!!\n\nPanel 6. Small panel overlaying 7. Focus on Shazam’s face. There are some bullets bouncing off it.\n\nSFX: PING PING!\n\nPanel 7. Pull out. Billy, Johnny Quietus and Jonas Glim are all firing their guns at Shazam. We can see Bludhound lying in front of Shazam, unconscious and slightly toasty.\n\nSFX: RATATATATAT!!! (over the guns)\n\nPanel 8. Shazam vanishes. They all stop firing.\n\nPanel 9. Close-in on the three crew members. We can see Shazam’s chest standing behind them, still covered in lightning. They do *not* look confident about their chances.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-THREE - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Lobo is pulling himself up out of the mine. He’s injured but healing.\n\nLOBO\nRuddin’ little brat. Just wait ‘til I get my fraggin’ hands on your entrails!

Mister Atom’s head, flying through the open air and right towards Lobo and his crew.\n\nPanel 6. Mister Atom’s head CRASHES into the opening of the mine, trapping them all inside.\n\nSFX: BOOOOOOOOOOOMMM!!!\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-FOUR - EIGHT PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Small panel overlaying 2. Shazam’s axe slicing through a rope.\n\nPanel 2. Wide panel. The citizens, now free of their ropes, all getting up. Regina is rubbing Tawny’s cheeks. Shazam is staring at the sky, back to everyone. The citizens all seem jubilant. Minerva is counting heads and making sure everyone’s alright.\n\nMINERVA\nIs anyone injured?\n\nREGINA\nOoh! Who’s a good, brave kitty? You are!\n\nTAWNY\nPurrrr….\n\nCITIZEN #1\nWe’re all good, Minerva! Thanks to our new friend, there!\n\nCITIZEN #2\nThree cheers for--\n\nPanel 3. --Shazam, his face dark, still staring at the sky.

Regina, confused.\n\nREGINA\nBut it *is* over! Lobo--\n\nPanel 6. Regina, scared.\n\nSHAZAM (O.S.)\n--Was never the *real* threat! You have to listen to me and leave *right now!*\n\nPanel 7. Pull out. We can see the Crocodile-Priest standing up and pointing an accusatory finger at Shazam. All we see of Shazam is the back of his head and shoulder.\n\nCROCODILE-PRIEST\n*Of course* he wasn’t the real threat! The *true* enemy is standing before us! Don’t you all realize *who* he is?\n(beat)\nThe lightning? The axe? His power to change form!?\n\nPanel 8. Close-in on the Crocodile-Priest’s face.\n\nCROCODILE-PRIEST\nHe’s the Thunder King! The Great Destroyer!\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-FIVE - SPLASH PAGE**\n\nPanel 1. We turn our gaze to the sky, and it’s only now that we realize we’ve never actually *seen* the sky until this very moment. High in the sky, stretching from one end of the horizon to the other, is a *massive,* green-and-black, WORM-LIKE BODY. There is no visible head or tail on the body, it just keeps going in both directions. The body is bent, suggesting it follows the curvature of the Earth. The sun has set enough that we can make out the moon. It’s been *fragmented,* floating next to a very tiny patch of stars in a *red* outer space. MR. MIND, now big enough to envelope the planet. Everyone else below looks so miniscule next to his scale.\n\nCROCODILE-PRIEST\n--The enemy of God!\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-SIX - SEVEN PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. We’re back down with citizens. They’re all looking up at the sky, concerned.\n\nSFX: SKKKKKREEEEEEEEEEE!!!\n\nCITIZEN #1\nWha-what is that?\n\nPanel 2. Focus on Regina. She’s both concerned *and* confused.\n\nREGINA\nIt...it can’t be…\n\nPanel 3. A futuristic city with massive skyscrapers and flying cars. Mr. Mind’s body is also visible in the skyline, making that same noise. There are PEOPLE WEARING CYBERNETIC OUTFITS looking up at him. There’s a faded white border around this panel and the next, suggesting a flashback.\n\nSFX: SKKKKKKKREEEEEEEEEE!!!!\n\nPanel 4. Focus on TWO PARENTS holding a YOUNG REGINA. All three are staring at the sky, terrified. Young Regina is clutching her MOTHER tight.\n\nSFX: SKKKKKKREEEEEEEEEEE!!!!\n\nPanel 5. Back in the present. Regina facing the citizens.\n\nREGINA\nHe’s right! We have to leave! Quickly!\n\nPanel 6. The other citizens looking at Regina in concern. Minerva is stepping towards her.\n\nMINERVA\nRegina--\n\nREGINA\n--No, *listen to me!*\n\nPanel 7. Regina again. She’s crying.\n\nREGINA\nI’m from the Gamelands! I was there when the Great Mind destroyed it! *He’s going to kill us all!*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-SEVEN - FIVE PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Minerva, leading all the citizens of Salvation Valley along a mountain path. Regina is riding Tawny. We can see the town in the background.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: And so we left. All of us. We didn’t even have enough time to grab our things\n\nPanel 2. Close-in on the town. We can see lightning flashing in its center.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: As for Bill--*whoever* he was…\n\nPanel 3. Shazam staring up at Mr. Mind’s body.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: He elected to stay behind….\n\nMR. MIND\nCHAMPION...I SEE YOU!*\n\n(*Note: Mr Mind’s dialogue has *no* balloons or captions. They’re an SFX unto themselves)\n\nREGINA [CAP]: So that he could keep the Great Mind’s attention on him--*only* him--\n\nPanel 4. Close-in on Mind’s body. Emerging from the body are THE WORM-MEN (six feet tall, green-and-black skin, elongated limbs, a giant, open sucker with flailing tendrils where a face should be).\n\nREGINA [CAP]: --And fight his angels.\n\nPanel 5. Pull out. Mr. Mind’s body above Salvation Valley. LEGIONS OF WORM-MEN are falling off the body and diving for the town below.\n\nMR. MIND\n*DIE!*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-EIGHT - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Long panel. Shazam, hacking and slashing his way through the worm-men. Their blood is green.\n\nPanel 2. Long panel. Shazam continues his onslaught. There are even more worm-men than before, threatening to overwhelm the panel.\n\nPanel 3. Long panel. Too many worm-men. All we see of Shazam is his face, mouth open in a defiant roar as the worm-men drag him down...\n\nPanel 4. Small panel beneath 1. The outside of Salvation Valley. There’s a ball of lightning generating in the center.\n\nPanel 5. Small panel beneath 2. The ball has expanded, covering the entirety of the town.\n\nPanel 6. Small panel beneath 3. Nighttime. No more lightning, no more worm-men. No more *town.*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-NINE - EIGHT PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Still nighttime. The townsfolk are holding lanterns. They’re on the side of a mountain. Regina and Tawny are running down the mountainside. Billy lies unconscious beneath them.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: We found him an hour later. We’re still not sure how he managed to survive.\n\nREGINA\nHe’s down here!\n\nPanel 2. Billy talking with the townsfolk. He's wearing a new, red shirt and holding Tawny's reins.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: Doc stitched him back up--*again*--and Minerva said they were even now for saving our lives from Lobo.\n\nPanel 3. Close-in on the townsfolk, Minerva in the center. They are *not* pleased.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: But it was *his* fault Lobo was there at all. *His* fault the Great Mind destroyed our town.\n\nPanel 4. Billy and Tawny walking away from the townsfolk.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: He was the Thunder King, the Enemy of God.\n\nPanel 5. Billy riding Tawny, off into the night. We can still see Mr. Mind's body stretching across the sky.\n\nREGINA [CAP]: He would *always* be alone.\n\nPanel 6. Billy and Tawny stop. Billy's looking off into the distance.\n\nBILLY\nYou...you're the girl who was taking care of Tawny. Regina, right?\n\nREGINA (O.S.)\nThat's right.\n\nPanel 7. Billy's looking up at the sky. We still can't see Regina.\n\nBILLY\nSomething I can help you with?\n\nREGINA (O.S.)\nIs it true, what they say? *Are* you trying to kill the Great Mind?\n\nPanel 8. Billy's looking to the side, directly at us.\n\nBILLY\n…Maybe. I don't...I don't really know *what* I’ll do once I find his head.\n(lower)\nI'm just trying to do the right thing...*whatever* that is...\n\n**PAGE THIRTY - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. Regina, standing in front of Billy and now dressed like an old-school gunslinger (brown poncho, wide hat, green rifle similar to Minerva's slung over her shoulder). We can see the back of Billy's head, looking at her.\n\nBILLY\nHow about you? I heard what you said about the Gamelands. Do *you* want to kill him?\n\nPanel 2. Close-in on Regina, she's staring back at Billy. No hesitation.\n\nREGINA\nYes.\n\nPanel 3. Back with Billy. He's just looking at Regina.\n\nPanel 4. Billy slides back, making room for Regina. He's patting the empty space.\n\nBILLY\nWant some company?\n\nPanel 5. Regina has climbed on. We watch as her, Billy and Tawny walk off into the distance.\n\nREGINA\nSo...you really think you can stop him? *However* you plan to?\n\nBILLY\nWhy not? I got a tiger, a magic axe, and a friend. I’m *set!*\n\nREGINA\nIt’s *his* world.\n\nBILLY\nTrue...\n\nPanel 6. The stars. No Mind, just the stars. There seem to be more now than when we last looked. A few shining even brighter than before.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: But it’s *our* world, too.\n\n**NEXT ISSUE: \"CRUSH!\"**","date":"2020-04-29T07:00:00.000Z","_id":"9cfb28f69928442fbb660f03fd375b07"},{"title":"Long Way From Home, Part I: Everything Is (Not) All Right","number":1,"series":"c13b6ad049fd4f4abec033abe90b2600","author":"1510047736564a5cb928d0bf18d6ff62","editor":"df18d55a94d546aaa2686cf40bb7a5fe","content":"**PAGE ONE**\nSplash page.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nSplash panel of the PLANET EARTH, viewed from space.

He has two arms and dual-wields blasters. He wears a basic brown jumpsuit, with a bandolier of energy grenades.\nMOSSY PIRATE: Unlike the other pirates, this one looks more like overgrown vegetation. Their body shape is vaguely humanoid, but somewhat amorphous, and their skin is covered entirely in a rusty orange moss. Their limbs are more like tentacles, and it’s not clear if they’re wearing clothes or if that’s just bark growing on them. The only distinct features on their face are a ragged gash of a mouth and two deep pits that presumably correspond to eyes. They wield an energy pike in one of their limbs.\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPIRATE LEADER: A spiderlike alien, but with ten legs instead of 8. She walks on three of the pairs, giving her four arms, each of which holds an energy cutlass. She wears a threadbare pirate jacket. She has ten eyes. One of them has an eyepatch. Also, one of her legs is a pegleg. This is the best thing I have ever created.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TEN**\nSix panels, three rows of two.

Boxes made of an orange, cardboard-like substance are scattered around in haphazard piles, labeled in alien writing. Thick, greenish dust covers most of the surfaces. Jessica, now having reverted to her civilian outfit of faded jeans and a baggy green hoodie, is tied to a rusty metal chair, one evidently made for a somewhat different body plan than her own. The ropes are made of a fibrous yellow material, presumably woven from the plants of this planet. Jessica’s RING sits on a table next to the Pirate Leader.

Nothing being wrong feels like something is wrong. Your mind is calm, but your body’s still amped up, so your brain starts throwing up all kinds of intrusive thoughts.

Beside the field is a SETTLEMENT DOME.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nWhat can you tell me about Hyphries?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRING\nThe planet Hyphries is a Haven-class terraform effort, which basically means it's a planet with no native population because it's an unlivable wasteland outside of sealed city domes.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nCutaway panel, but tinted green instead of sepia because what kind of shoddy GL book are we running here? Distant shot of an ALIEN CITY. It's clearly a city, but also clearly alien. The architecture is distinctly taller than Earth skyscrapers could support, appearing spindly, rickety, and largely cobbled together. The streets, both ground-level sidewalks and haphazard bridges spiderwebbed between buildings, are filled with ALIEN PEDESTRIANS --  not just of one species, but a wide assortment of them, ranging from mostly humanoid to clearly non.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRING (VO)\nAbout 5 years ago, Hal told a bunch of refugees to live here after their original destination planet got taken over by Khunds.

They’re all together in a large HOVERTANK, a LASER CANNON mounted on top of it. One of them, ARMADILLO PIRATE, sits in the turret position, manning it.

No other clothing; the Donald Duck rules apply here.\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINE**\nThree panels, one row of two and one large panel.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot as Jessica stands, a SHIELD CONSTRUCT in front of her, a hail of laser fire surrounding her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nWho ARE these guys??\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRING\nWorking on it.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up shot of Jessica, shield still raised.

He has two arms and dual-wields blasters. He wears a basic brown jumpsuit, with a bandolier of energy grenades.\nMOSSY PIRATE: Unlike the other pirates, this one looks more like overgrown vegetation. Their body shape is vaguely humanoid, but somewhat amorphous, and their skin is covered entirely in a rusty orange moss. Their limbs are more like tentacles, and it’s not clear if they’re wearing clothes or if that’s just bark growing on them. The only distinct features on their face are a ragged gash of a mouth and two deep pits that presumably correspond to eyes. They wield an energy pike in one of their limbs.\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"dialogue\nPIRATE LEADER: A spiderlike alien, but with ten legs instead of 8. She walks on three of the pairs, giving her four arms, each of which holds an energy cutlass. She wears a threadbare pirate jacket. She has ten eyes. One of them has an eyepatch. Also, one of her legs is a pegleg. This is the best thing I have ever created.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TEN**\nSix panels, three rows of two. The panels on this page are becoming somewhat wobbly, the panels strange parallelograms rather than squares.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot.

He’s unfurled himself out of his armor, and wicked-looking SPIKES protrude out of each of his joints. “Do armadillos have spiked joints?” I hear you wondering. Well, I remind you at this point that this alien is not, in fact, an actual armadillo, so it hardly matters.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium action shot.

Boxes made of an orange, cardboard-like substance are scattered around in haphazard piles, labeled in alien writing. Thick, greenish dust covers most of the surfaces. Jessica, now having reverted to her civilian outfit of faded jeans and a baggy green hoodie, is tied to a rusty metal chair, one evidently made for a somewhat different body plan than her own. The ropes are made of a fibrous yellow material, presumably woven from the plants of this planet. Jessica’s RING sits on a table next to the Pirate Leader.

In case you somehow didn’t memorize every detail of his design in the last issue, he is a froglike alien with four arms. Each arm has a hand with seven fingers. Each finger has four joints. It looks a little creepy.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOkay. Okay. Could be anything in there.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on Jessica’s face.

Jessica BURSTS through the door, ring at the ready.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nDirector Havausu, get down!!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nPOV shot. We see the room as Jessica sees it: completely empty except for the shocked-looking Director Havausu.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nOf course.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot of Jessica and the Director. He’s staring up at her, looking stunned. Jessica’s lowered her arm, looking a bit embarrassed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nOh. Well, uh. I, uh, got your distress call.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nOh! Oh my! You’re the Green Lantern!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on the Director’s face. It’s hard to tell from his alien features, but his face looks surprisingly kindly, if a bit uncanny valley.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nThank goodness you’re here!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of Jessica, standing awkwardly in the middle of the room.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (MUTTERING)\n“Thank goodness,” really?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRING (MUTTERING)\nTranslation is an ART, J-Bird.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nI was terrified they’d gotten you!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium two-shot.

The Director gestures to the window, though which the guards out front may be seen.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nThey much prefer to terrorize the streets than to watch over an old man. They know I can't go anywhere.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium two-shot of Jessica and the Director, sitting across from each other. Jess looks slightly uncomfortable -- this chair wasn't quite shaped for human bodies.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nDirector, what happened here? \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nThey showed up about… 28 days ago, give or take.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN**\nFour panels, stacked.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nFlashback panel. A group of the pirates, led by CAPTAIN ARAKA from the previous issue, sit around in a bar. They're throwing money around, having a good time.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR (VO)\nThey seemed harmless enough at first. Rough around the edges, but their creds spent as well as anyone else’s.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (VO)\nYou weren't suspicious? \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR (VO)\nYou have to understand, a struggling colony like this, we welcome any income we can get.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nStill a flashback panel, wide shot. The pirates stand around a group of terrified-looking civilians, looming and armed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (VO)\nWhat happened next?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR (VO)\nThey just kept coming. More of them every day. We didn't realize how MANY of them there would be! Not until it was too late.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nFlashback panel, wide shot. The Director stands in his office, speaking into something that looks like a communicator. The silhouettes of pirates menace him from the doorway.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR (VO)\nI managed to call for aid, but…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nInterior shot, over the shoulder. The Director looks out his window, watching the streets. Armed pirate guards watch over the masses, who walk by, downtrodden.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR (VO)\nI was afraid it would be for nothing.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN**\nFive panels, one row of three and two full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. The Director leans back in his chair, fingers steepled. Jessica leans her elbows on the desk.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nMy dear, I'm so glad to see you made it! Tell me, can you help us? What have you found?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nHonestly, not much.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot of Jessica as she leans across the table intently.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nDirector, those weapons they have… do you know anything about them?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of the Director, who spreads his hands out.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nWeapons? No, I can't say I know much about these things.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nIt _sounds_ plausible. But...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Jessica's face. She looks a bit nervous. Her internal monologue bubbles are all various shades of yellowish green, crowding in on each other.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nSomething isn't right here.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nYou already made enough of a fool out of yourself. Let it go.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nWhere are the guards? Why was he alone in here? It doesn't add up.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nDon't be the jerk who accuses the hostage.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nBetter to look like an idiot than _die._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot of the Director. He's rifling in his desk drawer. Jessica's internal monologue is still shading yellow.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nMy dear, you look like you've been through an ordeal. May I offer you anything to drink, perhaps? I have -- \n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\n**Something isn't right.**\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN**\nTwo panels, one splash panel and one inset in the lower right corner.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. The Director is now pinned to the wall by a green construct. An item falls from his hand.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on the fallen item. It's one of the laser rifles that the pirates have been using. Jessica's internal monologue has returned to its normal green.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nGreat. That’s going to feed my paranoia for _months._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Jessica stands in front of the Director, who is still pinned to the wall. The Director has dropped his affable facade, looking at Jessica with unvarnished hatred.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nDrop the act! Who are you really? Are you with them? Why?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nYou foolish girl. I told you already -- a struggling colony like this, we welcome any income we can get.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nAnother flashback panel, this time a true one. A medium two-shot as Captain Araka sits across from the Director. Her arms are extended, clearly making an offer. The Director's fingers are steeped in thought.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR (VO)\nTheir Captain made me an offer. Enough money to keep us running for a year, and all I had to do was lure in some hapless Lanterns.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nBack to the present, a close-up shot of the Director. He sneers.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nAnd I was _glad_ to do it. Do you have any idea how much we _hate_ you? You and your damned _Guardians_, what have you ever done for _us_? You dropped us here and _abandoned_ us! Do you put food on our tables? Replenish our oxygen filters? Put out our fires? No. You swan in every few years for some fugitive or another. And then you leave. You always _leave_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up on Jessica. She looks stricken.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nI --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nSame shot as before, but now Jessica's  expression has hardened.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nWhat about your people? I've seen them in the streets! That wasn't an act! You let these pirates terrorize them!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on the defiant Director. He tilts his head back.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nMy _people_ know nothing of the choices I have to make! All they care about is whether they'll have enough to make it to the next day! Well, I've ensured it! They'll come around.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN**\nFive panels, two rows of two and one full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot of Jessica and the Director.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nYou won't get away with this.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nAnd what will you do? Arrest me?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide shot. We can see the window of the office again, and see the guards on the streets outside, the terraform dome stretching above.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nLook around you. This is my city. You are hunted. You are _trapped._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on the Director. Disdain is clear on his face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nOr will you kill me? Hm? Execute me where I stand, in the name of your Guardians?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nAnother close-up on Jessica. She looks extremely unsure of herself.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nI --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot.

The Director watches Jessica leaving through the smashed window.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nNo, Green Lantern…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of the Director, watching her leave.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDIRECTOR\nI don't think you'll be coming back at _all._\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nFive panels, one full-width and two rows of two.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot from below.

Dad got sent upstate when I was three. Mom walked out entirely after. I *still* don't know what happened to her.\n\nCRUSH [CAP]: What's \"Philly?\"\n\nBILLY [CAP]: Just listen. This will all make sense by the end.\n\nPanel 4. Billy, running away from A GROCER and down a busy street. The Grocer is giving chase. Billy's carrying a bundle of food and has some bread in his mouth.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: I got bounced around a lot.

The inside of an orphanage. Billy is sitting in a chair.

A really nice group!\n\nBILLY [CAP]: They didn't know about my past, but, to be honest, I don't think they would have *cared.*\n\nPanel 6. The living room of the Vasquez home.

Billy standing in a circular room with a stone floor and seven thrones. A lightning bolt is carved into the floor and at the base of each throne.

Lightning is emitting from the tattoo on his chest.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: Shortly after that, I met the Wizard.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: The *real* Wizard.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: He was dying, you see, and needed a champion to take his place.\n\nWIZARD\nYes, the fires of good still burn bright within you!\n(beat)\nSpeak my name, Billy Batson!

The beating heart of a universe positioned towards chaos and greed!\n\nBILLY\nUm…\n\nTHE WIZARD\n*Sigh.* Do you remember the invasion from the Antimatter universe earlier this year?* \n\n(*As seen in \"Forever Evil\"--*HistorianThunder*)\n\nBILLY\nUnfortunately...\n\nPanel 3.

Back in the throne room.

MIND is sitting on his shoulder.\n\nTHE WIZARD [CAP]: If I am aware of the Rock's presence, then so, too, are Mind and Sivana. Mind has already consumed the power of Eternity! If he obtains Finality as well--!\n\nPanel 6. Shazam flying in an empty void. He’s heading towards the Rock of Finality (the real one).

We can see the SEVEN SACRED VIRTUES from Issue 1 beside him.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: But Mary and the rest of the family were visiting colleges that week, and the Wizard said I needed to hurry.\n\nBILLY [CAP]:Besides, it was *only* Mind and Sivana.\n\nPanel 3.

Pulling out even further. Mind's body is now taking up half the panel. Billy's just a tiny dot.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: The Seven Realms *aren't* supposed to be mashed together, twisted under his image.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: The Monster Society *isn't* supposed to be running free. We *aren't* supposed to worship Mind--sorry, \"the Great Mind\"--like a god.\n\nBILLY\nWizard!? Superman!?\n\nPanel 5. Mind's body now completely covers our view. We can't even see Billy anymore.\n\nBILLY [CAP]: ...I'm not supposed to be the only hero left...\n\nBILLY\n(small text)\nAnyone...?\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN - EIGHT PANELS**\n\nPanel 1.

She's facing Billy's direction, and clearly *p-----.*\n\nCRUSH\nFirst off, did you actually expect me to *buy* that &@^$ about \"kind couples adopting doe-eyed brats and wizards giving out magic like candy?\" What kind of sappy, no-brained moron do you *think* I am?\n\nPanel 7. Getting closer on Crush's face.\n\nCRUSH\nSecondly, *genius,* even if you what you said *was* true, then you're *goin' to fail!*\n(beat)\nYou said it yourself: you’ll *never* reach the Rock of What-Whose-it, so *all* you’re doin’ is just *wastin'* everybody's time, stirrin’ up trouble and gettin' everybody killed!\n\nPanel 8.

BRZZT!\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-NINE - SIX PANELS**\n\nPanel 1. A long, silvery chain-and-hook falls out of the box and hits the ground.\n\nPanel 2.

Crush is approaching them.\n\nJONAS\nYou filthy, little--\n\nCRUSH\n--Jonas.\n\n**PAGE THIRTY - FOUR PANELS**\n\nPanel 1.

We can see Mr. Mind’s body still stretching across the horizon.\n\nJONAS (O.S.)\nAaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!\n\nPanel 3. Beneath panel 2. Tawny and Regina rejoining Billy, all three dumbfounded by what just occurred.\n\nCRUSH (O.S.)\nSavin' the world, huh?\n\nPanel 4. Long panel taking up the rest of the page. Crush is facing the reader, grinning. Obelus has wrapped itself around her protectively. In the background, we can make out Starfish Island.

The border on the insert panel is diagonal and jagged, as though hidden under the protruding root of a tree.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot of an ALIEN FOREST. It’s not quite like anything we’ve seen before, with tall, skeletal trees covered in a ayellowish papery bark, but even to the unfamiliar eye, it looks a little… artificial. The tree heights just a little too similar, the spacing just a little too even. A comparison to tree farms would not be out of place. The sky in the background is tinted, distorted by the glass of a geodesic dome stretching over the forest. The sun is nowhere to be seen in the sky, but a large moon is creeping towards the horizon, casting its light across the dark sky of this strange place.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION BLURB\nNow.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nClose-up on a pair of sneakers, crunching against the forest floor.\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWO**\nSeven panels. The panels on this page are divided up not as the usual grid, but as though the borders are the trunk and branches of a tree, running up the center. The panel numbering begins with the lower left panel and goes clockwise around. Panel four is at the top center of the page.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium action shot of two additional figures, running through the trees. They’re facing to the viewer’s right. We can’t see much of them, but they clearly aren’t human, fur and limbs in strange places. One of them’s holding a red-and-white-striped alien gun.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot of a HUMANOID FIGURE. We can only see her back, and then only from the shoulders down, but her clothes look mostly terrestrial in nature: normal sneakers, normal jeans, a normal green sweatshirt. Two things, however, stand out as alien in nature: the walking staff she holds in one hand, a rough-hewn thing from the same wood as the surrounding trees, and a large knapsack, straps cinched awkwardly to fit a human figure, woven from a yellowish alien fabric. She looks almost like she’s hiking through the forest, but her shoulders are tense, her posture fearful.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up of the figure’s knapsack. A small, nonhumanoid figure has poked its head out of the knapsack, peering around. It’s a cat. A Russian Blue, specifically. Despite his situation, he looks… unusually calm.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nA shot of an ALIEN SHUTTLE. It’s seen better days, its orange paint job burned and peeled by many atmospheric exits and entries, its metal buckled and dented in places. Sizewise, it’s medium… clearly meant for ferrying passengers to and from a larger spacecraft, but capacious enough for several passengers. A group of three alien guards stand at attention by the entrance, all holding those same weapons as panel one. The figure stands in the foreground, hidden in the woods, surveying it.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on the figure. The hood on her sweatshirt is up, but she has a hand up to it. Her fingers are bare.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on the figure as she pulls the hood down. It’s JESSICA CRUZ.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium action shot, similar to panel one, except that these alien figures are different, and facing the opposite direction. Forces combing the forest.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (VO)\nOkay. So let’s go over the plan again.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THREE**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up shot of the PIRATE SHUTTLE. It looks fairly similar to the shot from the previous page, except for being semi-translucent and entirely green.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION BLURB\nYesterday.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (OFFSCREEN)\nWe need to get into those pirates’ _ship_. That’s still in orbit, which is a problem, since they’re guarding all the exits and we can’t get out of the dome. So that means our best chance is to leave the way _they_ leave. That means using their shuttle.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nPull back to a medium two-shot of Jessica and Dex-Starr, both camped out in the shadow of a rickety building and staring at a projection from Jessica's Ring. It's changed slightly from panel one, now instead showing a construct of a small alien forest, the same as the one we saw on the first two pages. The sun is low in the yellow-orange sky now, but rising. Mid-morning.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nThey’re not dumb enough to just park that in town square. But it needs to be somewhere inside the dome, since the atmosphere on the rest of the planet is basically death gas.

Will you rrrun becausse you _might_ not win?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up of Jessica, her eyes darting towards Dex-Starr. She looks annoyed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nFirst of all, stop acting like I'm a _coward_ because I don't want to take _stupid_ risks.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nEven if you’re kind of right.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nSecond of all, the problem with just attacking is that if they raise the alarm, then they'll lock their doors and blast us out of the sky. We need that shuttle to get _in_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FOUR**\nSix-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot of Dex-Starr and Jessica. He's floating in circles around her head, as he does. They both seem pretty irritated with each other.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nThisss issss yourr weaknesss. You do not know when to sssstrrrike!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nYeah? Well maybe _your_ weakness is trying to just attack everything you see!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium two-shot of Jessica and Dex-Starr, Dex-Starr floating at eye level so that they can glare at each other.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nYou arrrre too cautiousss. Too _afrrrraid_. _I_ will lead ussss.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nSo, you're an expert tactician now?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Dex-Starr bristles in affront.

Do not trrrreat me like a dumb animal!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jessica holds up her hands in the universal gesture of peace.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nOkay, okay! Sorry!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium two-shot. Jessica walks towards the end of the alley, hands by her side. Dex-Starr floats beside and slightly behind her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (MUTTERING)\nMan. Why doesn't my Ring make _me_ smarter?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nBut I still don't agree with you, okay? We can't risk them raising the alarm. We need to do this without --\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up on Jessica. She's staring, wide-eyed, at something behind the reader.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (SMALL)\n… being… seen.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nUm, Dex?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE FIVE**\nSplash page.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nSplash panel. Wide shot, from behind Jessica and Dex-Starr in the alley. Bearing down on their position, we can see no less than five HOVERTANKS, striped red and white and manned by assorted alien pirates.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\n… what do your tactics say about _this_?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGES SIX AND SEVEN**\nEleven panels in a two-page spread. Panels go from left to right and top to bottom, and are arranged as they would be in a six by six grid, except for panel number eleven in the center of the page. The sun travels through the sky in each of the first ten panels, getting first higher and higher, then lower and lower.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jessica and Dex-Starr flee from the tanks, flying low as energy blasts rain down from the sky above.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide shot. Dex-Starr fires what I can only describe as a hairball energy construct down the turret of one of the tanks, exploding it. It would seem like a victory for our heroes, were it not clearly a different tank than any of the ones in panel one.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nWide shot. Jessica bends the turret on a different tank upwards, causing its blast to go astray.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jessica flees through the streets, Dex-Starr in tow, wincing and shielding her head as a series of energy blasts crack the shield construct she’s raised behind her.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. Jessica and Dex-Starr hide underneath an unmanned market stall in an outdoor bazaar, which is empty except for the pirates who stomp past.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot. Dex-Starr scratches at the face of a wasp pirate who crouches down to check under the stall.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up. Jessica and Dex-Starr hide together in the shadows of a small yellow bush, black flowers blooming over it.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Jessica and Dex-Starr flee the bush as it gets obliterated by an energy blast.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nWide shot. Dex-Starr attacks a hippopotamus alien, clinging to his face and scratching, as Jessica dives for cover from a hail of blaster fire.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\nClose-up on Jessica and Dex-Starr, clearly in the midst of fleeing. Jessica looks desperate and exhausted, while Dex-Starr looks, well, pissed.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ELEVEN*\nClose-up on a SCREEN. It has a technical-looking MAP upon it. Two dots are clearly visible. One red, one green. We’ve seen this before. A TRACKING DEVICE.\n:::\n\n**PAGE EIGHT**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot of Jessica, leaning on her knees and breathing heavily. Being as she's been flying throughout these sequences, one might assume it's less exhaustion and more hyperventilation.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nI don't get it. They keep finding us. How do they keep…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nJessica POV shot. A close-up of the Ring on her finger.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\n… finding... us…\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nOh, _no_.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium two-shot. Jessica stands, holding her Ring up to her mouth, while Dex-Starr floats behind her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nRing. Is there any chance they're tracking… well, you?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRING\nCan't rule it out, J-Bird. Whatever tech they have is clearly targeting Lantern Rings.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nWell, can you cloak yourself? Now that we know?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRING\nI think so, but I'll have to go completely dark. Even the uniform is out.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nClose-up of Jessica. Her eyes are closed, and she's running a hand through her hair.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nOkay. Okay. I can deal with that. But what about Dex-Starr? Red Lanterns die or something if they take off their rings, right?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR (OFFSCREEN)\nSFX: HSSSS\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium two-shot. Dex-Starr is on all fours on the ground, looking back over his shoulder at Jessica, tail sticking rigidly in the air.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nOan prrrropaganda.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nOkay, whatever. But that means we can do this. We just need to remove our rings --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\n**No.**\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nMedium shot of Jessica, her arms spread in exasperation.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nJust until we can get on their ship, Dex. You can keep it right -- wait.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nSimilar shot to before, but Jessica has lowered her arms, staring at Dex-Starr with a look of realization.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESS\nYou’re just… a normal cat, right? What happens when you…?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nClose-up on Dex-Starr, back arched and fur bristling.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nSFX: HSSSS!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (OFFSCREEN)\nOh.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINE**\nEight panels, two rows of three and a row of two. Panel nine is twice the width of panel eight.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot. Jessica and Dex-Starr both look up at the sky. A hovertank looms in the distance.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nThey’re almost here. We’re out of time.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nTwo-shot of Jessica and Dex-Starr. Jessica looks exasperated, while Dex-Starr is once more literally bristling.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nLook, I get it, but there is _no way_ we can handle this kind of firepower like this! We gotta power down!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nNnneverrr!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nLook, I promise I’ll give yours back.

Don’t you have anyone you want to get back to?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Dex-Starr, ears still flat.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nSame as panel five, except that Dex-Starr’s mouth is open in a hiss.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nSFX: HSSS!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nIf you betrrray me… Atrrrocitusss will make you rrregrrret it.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (OFFSCREEN)\nOkay, whatever! Come on, we’re almost out of time!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up as Jessica carefully plucks the ring from Dex-Starr’s tail.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nFull-body shot of Dex-Starr, depowering. The red aura fades from his body, starting from his tail. He grimaces as if pained… even if the removal isn’t _fatal_, it doesn’t seem to be _pleasant_.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nSFX: RRRROW!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TEN**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot of the pirates in their hovertank. We see two of them now, and not ones we’ve seen before. The first one is a feathery six-winged orb creature. He has no visible mouth or eyes, but does wear a 360 degree wraparound visor halfway down his body. He also has a pair of four-taloned hands below his body, in which he holds his blaster in a set of opposable talons. The second one is a large non-humanoid squidlike creature wearing a close-fitting bodysuit. There’s water visible through her transparent visor, and she holds the device from before. This time, however, the dots are gone.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nSQUID\nThey’re gone!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nFEATHERS\nWhat? That can’t be right!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nWide shot of the hovertank, flying at a crawl through the sky. The sun is on the other side of the sky now, indicating that it's been nearly a day. The pirates looking over either edge of the tank, looking at the ground below them. We can see a variety of buildings, but no sign of either Jessica or Dex-Starr.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nFEATHERS\nSearch the area! They can’t have gotten far!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot of the hovertank, from behind and below. It’s going away from the future, pirates still searching.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Jessica, lurking in the shadows of a building, hidden from the eyes of the tank. She peers around the corner nervously, following the tank’s flight with her eyes, arms full of cat.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot of Jessica, still holding Dex-Starr. She slumps back against the wall in relief.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nSFX: Whew!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot of Jessica, Dex-Starr leaping out of her arms.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nHSSS!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nWoah!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nClose-up of Dex-Starr, now just a normal-looking cat, sitting on the ground.

You know… without the aura of rage-y death, you’re actually pretty cute.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (OFFSCREEN)\nWait. What’s this?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nClose-up on Dex-Starr’s now-visible collar, which just says “Dexter.”\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (OFFSCREEN)\nOh my GOD. Your name is DEXTER? What, did you just need it to sound all space-y?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nClose-up on Dex-Starr.

Dex-Starr is still riding along in her backpack, poking his head out. The world is yellow-gray with the predawn light.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (VO)\nGuess I'm going to need to find a carrier or something...\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nNARRATION BLURB\nNow.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nYou know… I used to _love_ the woods.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot.

And then...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up on Jessica, looking around cautiously.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nDo you have any idea what it's like? To have your entire life feel like it’s falling apart, and to just have one thing keeping you going? And then to just… lose it, and have nothing left to turn to? To miss it more than anything, and know that even when it’s THERE, you can NEVER get it back? To have the thing that you used to love now only bring you PAIN?\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nOkay. I think… I think they’re gone. They wouldn’t expect us this close.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nJessica POV shot of the pirate shuttle from earlier. It’s in the distance, barely visible through the trees, but distinctly recognizable.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI didn't leave my apartment for three years after my friends died. And sometimes, I think that if it weren't for Volthoom's ring… I'd never have left at all.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nClose-up on Jessica.

It’s --\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nWe’re almost there. We just need to… need to get on that shuttle somehow. Just need to...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWELVE**\nNine-panel grid.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium shot. Jessica collapses heavily to sit on a fallen log behind her.

It’s not going to be okay.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nClose-up. Jessica’s fingers twist in her hair, her face totally covered now between her hands and her bangs.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESS (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHow the hell am I going to get in there alone?? I don’t even have my RING! I can’t do this. I can’t do this. They’re going to find me and I can’t _do this_!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot. Jessica sits on the log, just looking completely despondent.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nJessica is in the same pose as in panel four, but now we can see Dex-Starr, poking more of his body out of Jessica’s backpack.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nSFX: Mrrr?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nMedium shot.

It is the most adorable Goddamn thing you have ever seen.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nDouble close-up. Dex-Starr rubs his head under Jessica’s chin. She closes her eyes, tears running down her face. It’s not an exact recreation, but if you have read Dex-Starr’s origin story, you know _exactly_ the shot I’m evoking here.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nJessica hugs Dex-Starr to her chest, head still lowered.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\n… thanks, Dex.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN**\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nMedium two-shot. Dex-Starr hops down off of Jessica’s lap. She continues to sit there, head hanging down, arms on her knees.

One is a large, ratlike creature wearing pants but no shirt; one, a hulking gray-skinned, four-armed and four-legged homunculus looking guy; and the third is a Dominator, and a heavily tattooed one. They are all holding red-and-white striped guns.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot. The Dominator walks, patrolling around the edge of the ship, but seeming bored.

Two hovertanks fly beside it, manned by some of the pirates from the earlier chase, but they seem unfazed by the departure of their own shuttle. One of the aliens even salutes.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nClose-up shot of Jessica inside the shuttle, looking out the shuttle’s front “windshield” at the surrounding vacuum of space. The pirates’ spacecraft can now be seen in orbit, a large interstellar rocket with a rusty orange paint job and multiple laser cannons on all sides.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nHey, I can see their ship now.

Two pirate crew members walk in the foreground, but they’re chatting with each other and don’t seem to be particularly concerned by the comings and goings of the shuttle. Business as usual. In the background, we can see Jessica’s and Dex-Starr’s heads poking through the shuttle door.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nSame shot as panel one, except Jessica and Dex-Starr are quickly slipping through a door about halfway up the hallway, unnoticed by the distracted pirates.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nInterior wide shot as Jessica and Dex-Starr enter what looks like some type of meeting room. There’s a table in the center, and a set of terminals on the opposite wall.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nOkay. Now we’re getting somewhere, probably.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nHrrh. What now?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot as Jessica begins to use one of the terminals, fingers splayed across the alien keyboard.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nHonestly, no idea. I’m just kind of hoping that my Ring can interface with their computers…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nMedium shot. A holographic screen has suddenly appeared above the terminal, displaying a number of blueprints, all apparently some form of weaponry. Jessica looks a bit startled, not having expected quite that effect.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\n-- whoa!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN**\nSix panels, one row of three, one of two, and one full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nJessica leans over, examining the terminal.

Can we focus here?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Jessica at the terminal, Dex-Starr beside her. She’s looking over what appears to be schematics for the ship they’re on.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nIf I’m reading this right, those weapons have a central power source on this ship. Kind of like a super-sized version of our Lanterns. Or a miniature version of the central Power Battery, I guess. But if we can destroy it, they’ll run out of juice within a day or two. Bet they’ll turn tail and run pretty quick once that happens…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nJessica walks over to one of the other doors in the room, pressing a button beside it to open it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nIt should be right through…\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nJessica POV shot. In this room, we do indeed see a large, red-and-white striped container, presumably the BATTERY. Unfortunately for our heroes, we also see CAPTAIN ARAKA standing at a table in the center of the room, speaking to a holographic projection of a shadowed, indistinct figure. If you remember issue one, you might assume this to be one of the BUYERS she mentioned. She looks up at the new arrivals with some surprise. She is still very armed.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\n… Here…\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nCrap.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY**\nTen panels, two rows of three and a row of four.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nWide shot of Araka, now wielding an energy cutlass in each hand.

Araka, for her part, looks unconcerned by the flying superpowered cat barreling straight towards her face.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nDEX-STARR\nSFX: RRREOWL!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nARAKA\nI admit, I’m _almost_ impressed. I never thought you’d make it out of the city.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL THREE*\nMedium shot. Araka casually swats Dex-Starr aside with one of her cutlasses, the remaining three still pointing towards Jessica.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nARAKA\nBut I would have expected you to seek reinforcements. Coming here _alone_? That was _foolish_.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (OFFSCREEN)\nWell...\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FOUR*\nMedium shot of Jessica. Her expression is… perhaps not confident, but resolute, determined. It probably helps that she is now absolutely COVERED in a Green Lantern armor construct now, holding a construct sword of her own.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nWe’ve already got _two_ Lanterns.

Jessica knocks one of the cutlasses to the side.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nMedium shot. Jessica dodges a second cutlass, the blade just barely missing her side.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nI have _no_ idea how to swordfight, by the way.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nJessica lunges towards Araka with her sword.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nJust kind of hoping I can power my way through here.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nSFX: YAAAAH!\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TEN*\nJessica staggers backwards as one of the cutlasses connects across her midsection. Her armor holds, but the construct shows deep cracks in it.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot working great so far.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE**\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nDouble close-up on Jessica, blocking one of the energy cutlasses with her sword. Their blades are locked, the blade showing cracks, and Jessica’s face showing strain.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nRING\nJeez!

Jessica swings her sword downward towards Araka, who blocks it with two of her cutlasses. Now Araka is the one who’s defending, but it’s still Jessica’s construct sword that’s showing cracks.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL FIVE*\nWide shot. Araka shoves outward with her swords, sending Jessica flying backwards, her construct sword finally shattering as she hits the ground heavily.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nARAKA\nSFX: ARRGH!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nSFX: OOF\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SIX*\nJessica, still in a prone position, holds her ring up, a construct net flying towards Araka.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL SEVEN*\nAraka swings all of her cutlasses, easily sundering Jessica’s construct.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nARAKA\nYou expect to catch me in my own _web_, Lantern?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL EIGHT*\nWorm’s-eye view of Araka as she stands over Jessica, pointing all four of her weapons down at her.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nARAKA\nI almost _admire_ your determination. But it’s pointless to fight me. I already dispatched your _friend_. You’ll go the same way.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL NINE*\nJessica pushes herself up onto her arms. It seems bleak, but for some reason, she’s… smiling?\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nSFX: heh!\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA\nYou… really think… _that’s_ what happened?\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO**\nSix panels, a row of three, a row of two, and one full-width.\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL ONE*\nClose-up. Araka dares a glance over her shoulder, two of her swords still pointed towards Jess, two raised at the ready to defend.\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot of DEX-STARR, attacking.

Jessica stands above the fallen Araka. The pirate captain is still conscious, but her weapons are scattered, and she’s trapped in a large construct, shaped like an upside-down cup. The entire rest of the room looks _very_ exploded, the battery clearly well and truly gone now.\n\n\"\"\"dialogue\nJESSICA (INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)\nNot gonna lie… pretty proud of myself right now.\n\"\"\"\n:::\n\n::: panel\n*PANEL TWO*\nMedium shot.

The Queen is facing the rock, her sceptre glowing.\n\nQUEEN OF FABLES\nReally? A *rock?*\n\nPanel 2. View of the Queen from the side. She’s smirking in a condescending manner. The rock is about to pass by her...\n\nQUEEN OF FABLES\nEven if you *could* hit me, I don’t see what you--\n\nPanel 3. The crystal heart on the Queen’s scepter is flaring up.

TITLE: PANACEA PART I – THE MIRACLE CURE\n\n**PAGE TWO – NINE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThree men in dark clothes and ski masks are gathered around a rooftop door.

BATMAN: (Off-panel) I assume you lost your *keys*, gentlemen?\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe three burglars look over their shoulders in shock. A dark shadow is cast over them.

GORDON: [Off-panel] I’m getting too old for this.\n\n**PAGE THREE – SEVEN PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nCOMMISSIONER JAMES GORDON is standing in the foreground, lit by the signal off to the side. Batman is on the edge of the roof in the background, still in silhouette.\n\n1. BATMAN: We all are, Jim.\n\n2. GORDON: Hmph. And here I was starting to *buy* the rumors that you’re immortal.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Caption) James Gordon. Police Commissioner. My friend.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Batman stepping into the light. The expression on his face doesn’t quite rise to the level of a smile, but is at least more pleasantly neutral than usual.\n\n1. BATMAN: No such luck. Why the Signal? Did you locate any of the Arkham escapees*?\n\n2. CAPTION: *A mass breakout happened in the smash DCW: Alpha oneshot!

Call came in from the CEO of *Gothcorp*, of all people.\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle of Batman and Jim.\n\n1. BATMAN: The new one. Gorman?\n\n2. GORDON: The same. He tells me Gothcorp is rolling out some kind of miracle drug. He was cagey with the details, but to hear him talk you’d think it turns lead into gold and donkeys into unicorns.\n\n3. BATMAN: Smells like a con.\n\n4. GORDON: Probably *is*. But Gorman seems to think that after the public announcement, someone will try to steal it. That’s where *you* come in.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup of Batman, one eyebrow raised.\n\n1. BATMAN: So I’m playing watchdog for a phony drug? *Now,* of all times?\n\n**Panel Six**\nJim turns to gesture at a skyscraper in the distance with “Gothcorp” written across the side in large neon letters.\n\n1. GORDON: Thought you should at least hear about it. I’m more worried about what happens if one of our escapees hits their headquarters. Besides, if it *is* all a fraud, you can—\n\n**Panel Seven**\nJim turns back towards Batman and he’s gone.\n\n1. GORDON: —Every damn time.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle on the Batmobile driving down a Gotham street, splashing water up towards the reader. Dawn is beginning to peek through the clouds in the background.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) I’ve been watching Gorman ever since I helped land his predecessor in prison.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) He’s invited Bruce Wayne—and about half the reporters and socialites in Gotham—to a reception at Gothcorp International Headquarters in the Diamond District of Old Gotham. He’s set to make a major announcement.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Unless I miss my guess, Jim’s just spoiled the big surprise for me.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShow the Batmobile pulling into the cave’s entrance from inside, a red-and-white striped roadblock rising back into place in the background outside.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman is exiting the Batmobile. ALFRED is dusting the Bat-Computer in the background.\n\n1. ALFRED: I trust tonight’s adventures were suitably violent, Master Bruce?\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Alfred Pennyworth. Family Butler. He raised me after my parents’ death.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Batman removing his mask to reveal BRUCE WAYNE.\n\n1. BRUCE: Just a few second-story men. No trouble.\n\n2. ALFRED: (Off-panel) My condolences, sir.\n\n**Panel Two**\nAlfred folds his arms and gives his best disapproving stare.\n\n1. ALFRED: And might I ask what urgent matter brings you to your ancestral home at five in the morning?\n\n**Panel Three**\nBruce is hanging up his cape and belt.\n\n1. BRUCE: Actually, I thought I might catch up on some sleep so I can attend a social function.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Alfred, one eyebrow raised skeptically.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle.\n\n1. ALFRED: Are you *certain* you’re *entirely* all right, sir?\n\n**PAGE SIX – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nEstablishing shot of a municipal-looking building, with copious columns and relief sculptures. It’s daytime. A small figure is ascending its front steps.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over the shoulder of DEREK ALTMAN, a balding, overweight man in a suit, looking down the steps at CHELSEA MCKAY, a twenty-something woman, about four feet tall, in an overcoat with round, monolithically large glasses. A resemblance to Velma Dinkley would not be entirely coincidental.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Sorry to keep you waiting. Uh, *am* I late?\n\n2. DEREK: Just on time. And it’s not *exactly* an appellate proceeding.\n\n**Panel Two**\nChelsea and Derek are filing through the door into a large, marble-tiled lobby.\n\n1. CHELSEA: I just wanted to thank you again. For taking me on, that is.\n\n2. DEREK: Thank *us?* With your credentials?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Chelsea.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Well, I mean, it’s not- It’s just-\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Derek.\n\n1. DEREK: Don’t be so modest, kid. Tell me, why’d you give up clerking?\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe two pass through another door, which swings out towards the reader so that the writing on the frosted glass is legible. It says “DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE.”\n\n1. CHELSEA: I think you know why.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – EIGHT PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot of the doorway from inside the office. The office well lit, but cluttered with cardboard boxes full of paperwork. Several desks are scattered around the room. Derek has turned to face Chelsea.\n\n1. DEREK: Your old man was a helluva lawyer. I always said they don’t make ‘em like Chuck McKay anymore, but I figure you’ve got plenty of time to prove an old fart like me wrong.\n\n2. VIC: (Off-panel) She just got here, Altman. Let her get a conviction or two before we crown the next Harvey Dent.\n\n**Panel Two**\nVIC CLARENCE, a scruffy-looking man in his mid-thirties, shakes Chelsea’s hand from his desk while Derek folds his arms in the background.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Chelsea McKay, I’m the new ADA.\n\n2. VIC: Vic Clarence. I’m an *old* ADA.\n\n3. DEREK: You know better than to joke about Harvey, Vic.\n\n**Panel Three**\nVic waves his hand at Derek.\n\n1. VIC: C’mon, Derek. Arkham screwballs are a fact of life for us.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Derek, grimacing.\n\n1. DEREK: Harvey’s *different*.\n\n**Panel Five**\nJANET CROFT, a middle-aged woman in a crisp suit, leans out from behind another desk.\n\n1. JANET: *Easy,* boys. New kid in town doesn’t need to see you two tearing each other’s throats out. Want me to get her set up with a caseload?\n\n**Panel Six**\nDerek straightens out his suit as Chelsea walks over to Janet.\n\n1. DEREK: Yes, of course. Thank you, Janet.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nJanet lays out a stack of papers on the desk in front of Chelsea.\n\n1. JANET: Welcome to the family, McKay. One good thing about working in Gotham is you never get bored.\n\n2. CHELSEA: I don’t suppose any of this relates to… the Penguin?\n\n3. JANET: Trust me, kid.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nCloseup of Janet.\n\n1. That’s one case you’d better hope you *never* get.\n\n**PAGE NINE – EIGHT PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh angle of a police car pulling up to the curb next to an old, worn-down brownstone. It’s darker than the last scene, but still day. Two more police cars are already parked.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHARVEY BULLOCK exits the cruiser holding a half-eaten doughnut. OFFICER 1, a uniformed officer, is stepping up to greet him.\n\n1. BULLOCK: OK, where’s the stiff?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: Uh, it’s upstai-\n\n3. BULLOCK: Just show me. And while we’re on the way, tell me why Major Crimes got this instead of Homicide, huh?\n\n**Panel Three**\nAngle from behind Bullock and Officer 1 as they’re walking down a hallway. There are doors, some of which have numbers and most of which have places where numbers used to be before they were worn off over time. The carpet has probably not been vacuumed in twenty years. OFFICER 2 is ducking into a door ahead.\n\n1. BULLOCK: That the place?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: That’s the bathroom, Detective Bullock.\n\n**Panel Four**\nAngle from ahead of Bullock and Officer 1 as they pass the bathroom door. Bullock’s doughnut is still in his hand, albeit a few bites smaller.\n\n1. OFFICER 2: (From inside the bathroom) *Urrrrf!*\n\n2. BULLOCK: Rookies.\n\n**Panel Five**\nOfficer 1 points into an open door.\n\n1. OFFICER 1: In here, sir.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup of Bullock in the doorway.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nThe same angle. Bullock is holding up his doughnut and looking at it suspiciously.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nBullock turns back to Officer 1.\n\n1. BULLOCK: I wasn’t gonna eat this anyway. You want it?\n\n**PAGE TEN – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBullock and Officer 1 are leaning on either side of the bathroom door. Inside, Officer 2 is washing his face.\n\n1. BULLOCK: So, this mess has been here, what? A day? Two days?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: Or longer.\n\n3. BULLOCK: Let me guess. The landlord only found it because the neighbors complained about the smell.\n\n4. OFFICER 1: Apparently, one of them threatened to call a lawyer.\n\n**Panel Two**\nOfficer 2 steps up to the doorway.\n\n1. BULLOCK: So our perp’s long gone, and I ain’t *certain*, but that didn’t look like enough chunks to make a whole human, so that ain’t even all of our *victim*.\n\n**Panel Three**\nOfficer 2 is now kneeling back by the toilet.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce is riding in the back of an expensive-looking black sedan. It’s night again outside. We see the edge of Alfred’s shoulder in the driver’s seat.\n\n1. BRUCE: Is everyone in position?\n\n2. ROBIN: (Via communicator) I’m set up with visual, but the most suspicious thing I’ve spotted is whatever they’ve got on the hors d’oeuvres tray.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Robin. An apprentice of sorts. The third to hold the title.\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) I’m inside their system. Their security is cutting edge… for about fifteen years ago.\n\n5. BATMAN: (Cap) Oracle. Formerly known as Batgirl. Now the superhero world’s foremost researcher and tech expert.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Bruce through the side window.\n\n1. BRUCE: Any data on our miracle drug?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Weirdly, no. Almost nothing. I’ve got some references to a “Project: Panacea” in budget documents but no testing records, no advertising material, and certainly no formula.\n\n3. BRUCE: Keep me posted. All right, I should be fashionably late enough by now. You can stop circling, Alfred.\n\n**Panel Three**\nWide shot of Bruce exiting the car onto a crowded sidewalk full of well-dressed people.\n\n1. VICKI: (Off-panel) Bruce!\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – FOUR PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce turns, facing VICKI VALE, who is running up to him waving a notepad.\n\n1. VICKI: I wasn’t expecting to see *you* here. Any insight on the mystery announcement?\n\n2. BRUCE: *I* wasn’t expecting to see me here either. I’m just a curious citizen tonight.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Vicki Vale. Reporter for the Gotham Gazette. We were close once. I made some sacrifices and more mistakes, but she eventually forgave me.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from in front of the two as they shuffle through the front door into a huge, ostentatious glass atrium.\n\n1. VICKI: You sure you’re not holding out on me?\n\n2. BRUCE: Promise. I’ll probably learn more from whatever *you* write than I will from the announcement.\n\n3. VICKI: Oh, I’ve heard *that* one before, Mr. Wayne.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot over Bruce’s shoulder as Vicki flits off into the crowd.\n\n1. GUS: (Off-panel) Ladies and gentlemen!\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle of GUS GORMAN, a man in his thirties who fills out a suit very nicely, standing at a lectern at the rear of the atrium. A well-dressed elderly couple are exiting an elevator, a janitor is entering another, a woman in a black dress is going into the stairwell, and a flustered-looking waitress is trying to slide across the edge of the stage to get back into the crowd.\n\n1. GORMAN: I’m so glad you all could make it, and I hope you like… *whatever* it is the hors d’oeuvres are.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Gus Gorman. Wall Street turnaround specialist. Brought on as CEO to salvage Gothcorp’s stock price after Ferris Boyle went to prison for insider trading.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nSame angle, but pull in a little closer on Gorman.\n\n1. GORMAN: It won’t do any of us any good to sugarcoat things. Gothcorp has made a lot of mistakes in the past. But I was hired to change all that. I was hired because I believe in change, progress, and new beginnings.\n\n**Panel Two**\nMove in for a closeup. Gorman is reaching into his jacket.\n\n1. GORMAN: Our incredible research team has been moving heaven and earth to *create* our new beginning. And the fruit of that effort…\n\n**Panel Three**\nExtreme closeup of Gorman’s hand holding a glass vial full of an almost-clear liquid with a very slight green tint.\n\n1. GORMAN: … Is *this*.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack out to the closeup. Gorman is holding the vial in front of his right eye.\n\n1. GORMAN: We call it “Panacea,” like the ancient Greek goddess of health—*universal* health, apparently. And you aren’t gonna believe this, but I’ll be darned if that isn’t what it does. Our testing so far indicates that Panacea can, with sufficient time and dosage, heal *any* injury.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe crowd erupts into raised hands and shouted questions. Bruce, in the foreground, is glancing suspiciously to the side.\n\n1. CROWD 1: How does it work?\n\n2. CROWD 2: Isn’t this too good to be true?\n\n3. CROWD 3: You don’t expect us to *believe* this?\n\n4. BRUCE: Something’s wrong about this.\n\n5. ORACLE: (Comm) *Everything’s* wrong about this.\n\n6. ROBIN: (Comm) But what if it really *does* do what he says?\n\n7. ORACLE: (Comm) It *doesn’t.*\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nA heavyset man in the crowd trips and falls.\n\n1. FALLING MAN: (SFX: Ghugh)\n\n2. CROWD 4: Oh my God!\n\n**Panel Two**\nBruce turns to look at the fallen man as a few more people begin to drop.\n\n1. BRUCE: Robin. Notice anything off about the waiters?\n\n2. ROBIN: (Comm) No, wh- Wait. There *are* none.\n\n3. BRUCE: Not *now*. So where…?\n\n**Panel Three**\nLow angle of a woman with long, dark hair in a waitstaff uniform approaching Gorman. She’s withdrawing a dagger from her sleeve.\n\n1. ROBIN: (Comm) There! Along the sides!\n\n**Panel Four**\nBruce tumbles over into a small round table covered with a tablecloth.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) This won’t be my cleanest change, but it’ll have to do.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWe see the tablecloth lying overtop of Bruce.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBatman rises from the floor towards the reader, throwing the cloth off.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe waitress assassin lunges at Gorman, knife in hand.\n\n1. GORMAN: Someone, help!\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup of a Batarang slicing through the assassin’s hand, making her drop the knife.\n\n1. SFX: SKKT!\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull out as Batman follows his weapon, sending the assassin sprawling with a punch to the face.\n\n1. GORMAN: You *did* come!\n\n**Panel Four**\nBatman grabs Gorman by the shoulder and begins to drag him away.\n\n1. BATMAN: There are more of them! *Move!*\n\n**Panel Five**\nAnother waitress, this one with shoulder-length blonde hair, is kneeling and firing a pistol.\n\n1. SFX: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman has his cape draped over Gorman and is pulling him into the stairwell. The gunshots are barely missing them.\n\n1. SFX: VTT! VTT! VTT!\n\n**Panel Two**\nA third waitress assassin, also blonde but with shorter hair, is kneeling next to the first one, who is still on all fours and bleeding from the nose. The second assassin is running up to them.\n\n1. ASSASSIN 3: You still kicking, Ches?\n\n2. ASSASSIN 1: I dink dat &@$#@!% broke by dose.\n\n3. ASSASSIN 2: What?\n\n3. ASSASSIN 1: Nebber bine, Buddy.\n\n**Panel Three**\nAngle from directly above Batman, still pulling Gorman up the stairs.\n\n1. BATMAN: Are there any other samples of Panacea in the building?\n\n2. GORMAN: The safe in my office – why?\n\n3. BATMAN: So I can protect you *and* them at the same time.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBatman is pushing a door open onto the next floor.\n\n1. BATMAN: Oracle. IDs on the assassins. Three women, two with knives, one with guns.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Asian and two blondes?\n\n3. BATMAN: Check.\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) Sounds like the Ravens. Leader is Cheshire. Bad news. Poison expert. Pistolera and Vicious are above-average in combat but not that bright. Names are pretty indicative.\n\n5. GORMAN: Who are you talking to? Where are we going? My office isn’t on this floor.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman is prying open the doors of the adjacent elevator.\n\n1. BATMAN: None of your concern, up, and we’re taking the elevator.\n\n2. GORMAN: Won’t those crazy people be inside?!\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot from inside the elevator shaft of Batman pulling out his grapnel gun.\n\n1. BATMAN: You ask too many questions.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from above Batman and Gorman. Batman is grappling up through the elevator shaft with Gorman in his free arm.\n\n1. GORMAN: *AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!*\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – TWO PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe Ravens are standing in the elevator, PISTOLERA on the left, VICIOUS on the right, and CHESHIRE in the middle. Vicious is tapping her fingers on the wall.\n\n1. SFX: T-t-t-t-tap!\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same shot. Pistolera looks at Vicious. Cheshire is grimacing.\n\n1. SFX: T-t-t-t-tap!\n\n2. PISTOLERA: You know, we *could’ve* taken the stai-\n\n3. VICIOUS: Shut up, Bunny.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – FOUR PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe Ravens burst out of the elevator into a carpeted hallway, brandishing their weapons.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Vicious.\n\n1. VICIOUS: Nobody here?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Pistolera.\n\n1. PISTOLERA: Maybe not here yet?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Cheshire.\n\n1. CHESHIRE: Mebbe ulreddy here. Buddy, jeck leff. Vish, wash de doors. I jeck right.\n\n2. PISTOLERA: (Off-panel) Got it. I… *think.*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman is crouched behind a corner. Cheshire is approaching towards the reader on the right. Gorman is cowering behind Batman to the reader’s left. On the far right is a boardroom separated from the hallway by a glass wall.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Don’t know what weapons she has poisoned. Can’t risk much contact.\n\n**Panel Two**\nClose in and turn the angle a little to the right so we see more of the boardroom. Batman lunges forward and grabs Cheshire by the arm.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShift so we’re a full ninety degrees from Panel One’s angle, closing in over Batman’s shoulder. He’s throwing Cheshire through the glass wall into the boardroom.\n\n1. SFX: KRRRRSSSSH!\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Cheshire. She’s picked up a glass shard from the wall and is spitting on it.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Even her *spit’s* poisoned. This isn’t a fight I can afford to have with a civilian in tow.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman throws down a smoke pellet and begins to turn, pushing Gorman ahead of him down the hallway.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe smoke begins to fill the hall as the poisoned glass shard flies into the cloud.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Batman, I just noticed something.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle of Batman pulling Gorman down a hallway.\n\n1. BATMAN: I’m a little busy right now, Oracle.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) This is important.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHigh angle of the same hallway, empty. The visual is grainy, as through the view of a low-quality camera.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) The security cameras aren’t showing you in the halls.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman and Gorman have reached a door with a plaque next to it saying “GUS GORMAN – CEO.” Batman is turning the doorknob.\n\n1. ORACLE: Comm) That means someone’s looping the footage, which means—\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman has pushed open the office door, revealing a slick but unadorned office. Several cardboard boxes are still stacked in the corner. Standing in front of the safe in the back wall is none other than CATWOMAN.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) —Someone else is in the building.\n\n2.

The expression on his face doesn’t quite rise to the level of a smile, but is at least more pleasantly neutral than usual.\n\n1. BATMAN: No such luck. Why the Signal? Did you locate any of the Arkham escapees*?\n\n2. CAPTION: *A mass breakout happened in the smash DCW: Alpha oneshot! Where were you? - SelfEditingJamags\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Jim lighting his pipe.\n\n1. GORDON: Don’t count yourself out just yet. Call came in from the CEO of *Gothcorp*, of all people.\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle of Batman and Jim.\n\n1. BATMAN: The new one. Gorman?\n\n2. GORDON: The same. He tells me Gothcorp is rolling out some kind of miracle drug. He was cagey with the details, but to hear him talk you’d think it turns lead into gold and donkeys into unicorns.\n\n3. BATMAN: Smells like a con.\n\n4. GORDON: Probably *is*. But Gorman seems to think that after the public announcement, someone will try to steal it. That’s where *you* come in.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup of Batman, one eyebrow raised.\n\n1. BATMAN: So I’m playing watchdog for a phony drug? *Now,* of all times?\n\n**Panel Six**\nJim turns to gesture at a skyscraper in the distance with “Gothcorp” written across the side in large neon letters.\n\n1. GORDON: Thought you should at least hear about it. I’m more worried about what happens if one of our escapees hits their headquarters. Besides, if it *is* all a fraud, you can—\n\n**Panel Seven**\nJim turns back towards Batman and he’s gone.\n\n1. GORDON: —Every damn time.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle on the Batmobile driving down a Gotham street, splashing water up towards the reader. Dawn is beginning to peek through the clouds in the background.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) I’ve been watching Gorman ever since I helped land his predecessor in prison.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) He’s invited Bruce Wayne—and about half the reporters and socialites in Gotham—to a reception at Gothcorp International Headquarters in the Diamond District of Old Gotham. He’s set to make a major announcement.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Unless I miss my guess, Jim’s just spoiled the big surprise for me.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShow the Batmobile pulling into the cave’s entrance from inside, a red-and-white striped roadblock rising back into place in the background outside.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman is exiting the Batmobile. ALFRED is dusting the Bat-Computer in the background.\n\n1. ALFRED: I trust tonight’s adventures were suitably violent, Master Bruce?\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Alfred Pennyworth. Family Butler. He raised me after my parents’ death.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Batman removing his mask to reveal BRUCE WAYNE.\n\n1. BRUCE: Just a few second-story men. No trouble.\n\n2. ALFRED: (Off-panel) My condolences, sir.\n\n**Panel Two**\nAlfred folds his arms and gives his best disapproving stare.\n\n1. ALFRED: And might I ask what urgent matter brings you to your ancestral home at five in the morning?\n\n**Panel Three**\nBruce is hanging up his cape and belt.\n\n1. BRUCE: Actually, I thought I might catch up on some sleep so I can attend a social function.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Alfred, one eyebrow raised skeptically.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle.\n\n1. ALFRED: Are you *certain* you’re *entirely* all right, sir?\n\n**PAGE SIX – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nEstablishing shot of a municipal-looking building, with copious columns and relief sculptures. It’s daytime. A small figure is ascending its front steps.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over the shoulder of DEREK ALTMAN, a balding, overweight man in a suit, looking down the steps at CHELSEA MCKAY, a twenty-something woman, about four feet tall, in an overcoat with round, monolithically large glasses. A resemblance to Velma Dinkley would not be entirely coincidental.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Sorry to keep you waiting. Uh, *am* I late?\n\n2. DEREK: Just on time. And it’s not *exactly* an appellate proceeding.\n\n**Panel Two**\nChelsea and Derek are filing through the door into a large, marble-tiled lobby.\n\n1. CHELSEA: I just wanted to thank you again. For taking me on, that is.\n\n2. DEREK: Thank *us?* With your credentials?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Chelsea.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Well, I mean, it’s not- It’s just-\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Derek.\n\n1. DEREK: Don’t be so modest, kid. Tell me, why’d you give up clerking?\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe two pass through another door, which swings out towards the reader so that the writing on the frosted glass is legible. It says “DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE.”\n\n1. CHELSEA: I think you know why.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – EIGHT PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot of the doorway from inside the office. The office well lit, but cluttered with cardboard boxes full of paperwork. Several desks are scattered around the room. Derek has turned to face Chelsea.\n\n1. DEREK: Your old man was a helluva lawyer. I always said they don’t make ‘em like Chuck McKay anymore, but I figure you’ve got plenty of time to prove an old fart like me wrong.\n\n2. VIC: (Off-panel) She just got here, Altman. Let her get a conviction or two before we crown the next Harvey Dent.\n\n**Panel Two**\nVIC CLARENCE, a scruffy-looking man in his mid-thirties, shakes Chelsea’s hand from his desk while Derek folds his arms in the background.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Chelsea McKay, I’m the new ADA.\n\n2. VIC: Vic Clarence. I’m an *old* ADA.\n\n3. DEREK: You know better than to joke about Harvey, Vic.\n\n**Panel Three**\nVic waves his hand at Derek.\n\n1. VIC: C’mon, Derek. Arkham screwballs are a fact of life for us.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Derek, grimacing.\n\n1. DEREK: Harvey’s *different*.\n\n**Panel Five**\nJANET CROFT, a middle-aged woman in a crisp suit, leans out from behind another desk.\n\n1. JANET: *Easy,* boys. New kid in town doesn’t need to see you two tearing each other’s throats out. Want me to get her set up with a caseload?\n\n**Panel Six**\nDerek straightens out his suit as Chelsea walks over to Janet.\n\n1. DEREK: Yes, of course. Thank you, Janet.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nJanet lays out a stack of papers on the desk in front of Chelsea.\n\n1. JANET: Welcome to the family, McKay. One good thing about working in Gotham is you never get bored.\n\n2. CHELSEA: I don’t suppose any of this relates to… the Penguin?\n\n3. JANET: Trust me, kid.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nCloseup of Janet.\n\n1. That’s one case you’d better hope you *never* get.\n\n**PAGE NINE – EIGHT PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh angle of a police car pulling up to the curb next to an old, worn-down brownstone. It’s darker than the last scene, but still day. Two more police cars are already parked.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHARVEY BULLOCK exits the cruiser holding a half-eaten doughnut. OFFICER 1, a uniformed officer, is stepping up to greet him.\n\n1. BULLOCK: OK, where’s the stiff?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: Uh, it’s upstai-\n\n3. BULLOCK: Just show me. And while we’re on the way, tell me why Major Crimes got this instead of Homicide, huh?\n\n**Panel Three**\nAngle from behind Bullock and Officer 1 as they’re walking down a hallway. There are doors, some of which have numbers and most of which have places where numbers used to be before they were worn off over time. The carpet has probably not been vacuumed in twenty years. OFFICER 2 is ducking into a door ahead.\n\n1. BULLOCK: That the place?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: That’s the bathroom, Detective Bullock.\n\n**Panel Four**\nAngle from ahead of Bullock and Officer 1 as they pass the bathroom door. Bullock’s doughnut is still in his hand, albeit a few bites smaller.\n\n1. OFFICER 2: (From inside the bathroom) *Urrrrf!*\n\n2. BULLOCK: Rookies.\n\n**Panel Five**\nOfficer 1 points into an open door.\n\n1. OFFICER 1: In here, sir.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup of Bullock in the doorway.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nThe same angle. Bullock is holding up his doughnut and looking at it suspiciously.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nBullock turns back to Officer 1.\n\n1. BULLOCK: I wasn’t gonna eat this anyway. You want it?\n\n**PAGE TEN – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBullock and Officer 1 are leaning on either side of the bathroom door. Inside, Officer 2 is washing his face.\n\n1. BULLOCK: So, this mess has been here, what? A day? Two days?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: Or longer.\n\n3. BULLOCK: Let me guess. The landlord only found it because the neighbors complained about the smell.\n\n4. OFFICER 1: Apparently, one of them threatened to call a lawyer.\n\n**Panel Two**\nOfficer 2 steps up to the doorway.\n\n1. BULLOCK: So our perp’s long gone, and I ain’t *certain*, but that didn’t look like enough chunks to make a whole human, so that ain’t even all of our *victim*.\n\n**Panel Three**\nOfficer 2 is now kneeling back by the toilet.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce is riding in the back of an expensive-looking black sedan. It’s night again outside. We see the edge of Alfred’s shoulder in the driver’s seat.\n\n1. BRUCE: Is everyone in position?\n\n2. ROBIN: (Via communicator) I’m set up with visual, but the most suspicious thing I’ve spotted is whatever they’ve got on the hors d’oeuvres tray.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Robin. An apprentice of sorts. The third to hold the title.\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) I’m inside their system. Their security is cutting edge… for about fifteen years ago.\n\n5. BATMAN: (Cap) Oracle. Formerly known as Batgirl. Now the superhero world’s foremost researcher and tech expert.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Bruce through the side window.\n\n1. BRUCE: Any data on our miracle drug?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Weirdly, no. Almost nothing. I’ve got some references to a “Project: Panacea” in budget documents but no testing records, no advertising material, and certainly no formula.\n\n3. BRUCE: Keep me posted. All right, I should be fashionably late enough by now. You can stop circling, Alfred.\n\n**Panel Three**\nWide shot of Bruce exiting the car onto a crowded sidewalk full of well-dressed people.\n\n1. VICKI: (Off-panel) Bruce!\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – FOUR PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce turns, facing VICKI VALE, who is running up to him waving a notepad.\n\n1. VICKI: I wasn’t expecting to see *you* here. Any insight on the mystery announcement?\n\n2. BRUCE: *I* wasn’t expecting to see me here either. I’m just a curious citizen tonight.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Vicki Vale. Reporter for the Gotham Gazette. We were close once. I made some sacrifices and more mistakes, but she eventually forgave me.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from in front of the two as they shuffle through the front door into a huge, ostentatious glass atrium.\n\n1. VICKI: You sure you’re not holding out on me?\n\n2. BRUCE: Promise. I’ll probably learn more from whatever *you* write than I will from the announcement.\n\n3. VICKI: Oh, I’ve heard *that* one before, Mr. Wayne.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot over Bruce’s shoulder as Vicki flits off into the crowd.\n\n1. GUS: (Off-panel) Ladies and gentlemen!\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle of GUS GORMAN, a man in his thirties who fills out a suit very nicely, standing at a lectern at the rear of the atrium. A well-dressed elderly couple are exiting an elevator, a janitor is entering another, a woman in a black dress is going into the stairwell, and a flustered-looking waitress is trying to slide across the edge of the stage to get back into the crowd.\n\n1. GORMAN: I’m so glad you all could make it, and I hope you like… *whatever* it is the hors d’oeuvres are.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Gus Gorman. Wall Street turnaround specialist. Brought on as CEO to salvage Gothcorp’s stock price after Ferris Boyle went to prison for insider trading.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nSame angle, but pull in a little closer on Gorman.\n\n1. GORMAN: It won’t do any of us any good to sugarcoat things. Gothcorp has made a lot of mistakes in the past. But I was hired to change all that. I was hired because I believe in change, progress, and new beginnings.\n\n**Panel Two**\nMove in for a closeup. Gorman is reaching into his jacket.\n\n1. GORMAN: Our incredible research team has been moving heaven and earth to *create* our new beginning. And the fruit of that effort…\n\n**Panel Three**\nExtreme closeup of Gorman’s hand holding a glass vial full of an almost-clear liquid with a very slight green tint.\n\n1. GORMAN: … Is *this*.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack out to the closeup. Gorman is holding the vial in front of his right eye.\n\n1. GORMAN: We call it “Panacea,” like the ancient Greek goddess of health—*universal* health, apparently. And you aren’t gonna believe this, but I’ll be darned if that isn’t what it does. Our testing so far indicates that Panacea can, with sufficient time and dosage, heal *any* injury.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe crowd erupts into raised hands and shouted questions. Bruce, in the foreground, is glancing suspiciously to the side.\n\n1. CROWD 1: How does it work?\n\n2. CROWD 2: Isn’t this too good to be true?\n\n3. CROWD 3: You don’t expect us to *believe* this?\n\n4. BRUCE: Something’s wrong about this.\n\n5. ORACLE: (Comm) *Everything’s* wrong about this.\n\n6. ROBIN: (Comm) But what if it really *does* do what he says?\n\n7. ORACLE: (Comm) It *doesn’t.*\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nA heavyset man in the crowd trips and falls.\n\n1. FALLING MAN: (SFX: Ghugh)\n\n2. CROWD 4: Oh my God!\n\n**Panel Two**\nBruce turns to look at the fallen man as a few more people begin to drop.\n\n1. BRUCE: Robin. Notice anything off about the waiters?\n\n2. ROBIN: (Comm) No, wh- Wait. There *are* none.\n\n3. BRUCE: Not *now*. So where…?\n\n**Panel Three**\nLow angle of a woman with long, dark hair in a waitstaff uniform approaching Gorman. She’s withdrawing a dagger from her sleeve.\n\n1. ROBIN: (Comm) There! Along the sides!\n\n**Panel Four**\nBruce tumbles over into a small round table covered with a tablecloth.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) This won’t be my cleanest change, but it’ll have to do.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWe see the tablecloth lying overtop of Bruce.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBatman rises from the floor towards the reader, throwing the cloth off.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe waitress assassin lunges at Gorman, knife in hand.\n\n1. GORMAN: Someone, help!\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup of a Batarang slicing through the assassin’s hand, making her drop the knife.\n\n1. SFX: SKKT!\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull out as Batman follows his weapon, sending the assassin sprawling with a punch to the face.\n\n1. GORMAN: You *did* come!\n\n**Panel Four**\nBatman grabs Gorman by the shoulder and begins to drag him away.\n\n1. BATMAN: There are more of them! *Move!*\n\n**Panel Five**\nAnother waitress, this one with shoulder-length blonde hair, is kneeling and firing a pistol.\n\n1. SFX: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman has his cape draped over Gorman and is pulling him into the stairwell. The gunshots are barely missing them.\n\n1. SFX: VTT! VTT! VTT!\n\n**Panel Two**\nA third waitress assassin, also blonde but with shorter hair, is kneeling next to the first one, who is still on all fours and bleeding from the nose. The second assassin is running up to them.\n\n1. ASSASSIN 3: You still kicking, Ches?\n\n2. ASSASSIN 1: I dink dat &@$#@!% broke by dose.\n\n3. ASSASSIN 2: What?\n\n3. ASSASSIN 1: Nebber bine, Buddy.\n\n**Panel Three**\nAngle from directly above Batman, still pulling Gorman up the stairs.\n\n1. BATMAN: Are there any other samples of Panacea in the building?\n\n2. GORMAN: The safe in my office – why?\n\n3. BATMAN: So I can protect you *and* them at the same time.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBatman is pushing a door open onto the next floor.\n\n1. BATMAN: Oracle. IDs on the assassins. Three women, two with knives, one with guns.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Asian and two blondes?\n\n3. BATMAN: Check.\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) Sounds like the Ravens. Leader is Cheshire. Bad news. Poison expert. Pistolera and Vicious are above-average in combat but not that bright. Names are pretty indicative.\n\n5. GORMAN: Who are you talking to? Where are we going? My office isn’t on this floor.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman is prying open the doors of the adjacent elevator.\n\n1. BATMAN: None of your concern, up, and we’re taking the elevator.\n\n2. GORMAN: Won’t those crazy people be inside?!\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot from inside the elevator shaft of Batman pulling out his grapnel gun.\n\n1. BATMAN: You ask too many questions.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from above Batman and Gorman. Batman is grappling up through the elevator shaft with Gorman in his free arm.\n\n1. GORMAN: *AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!*\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – TWO PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe Ravens are standing in the elevator, PISTOLERA on the left, VICIOUS on the right, and CHESHIRE in the middle. Vicious is tapping her fingers on the wall.\n\n1. SFX: T-t-t-t-tap!\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same shot. Pistolera looks at Vicious. Cheshire is grimacing.\n\n1. SFX: T-t-t-t-tap!\n\n2. PISTOLERA: You know, we *could’ve* taken the stai-\n\n3. VICIOUS: Shut up, Bunny.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – FOUR PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe Ravens burst out of the elevator into a carpeted hallway, brandishing their weapons.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Vicious.\n\n1. VICIOUS: Nobody here?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Pistolera.\n\n1. PISTOLERA: Maybe not here yet?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Cheshire.\n\n1. CHESHIRE: Mebbe ulreddy here. Buddy, jeck leff. Vish, wash de doors. I jeck right.\n\n2. PISTOLERA: (Off-panel) Got it. I… *think.*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman is crouched behind a corner. Cheshire is approaching towards the reader on the right. Gorman is cowering behind Batman to the reader’s left. On the far right is a boardroom separated from the hallway by a glass wall.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Don’t know what weapons she has poisoned. Can’t risk much contact.\n\n**Panel Two**\nClose in and turn the angle a little to the right so we see more of the boardroom. Batman lunges forward and grabs Cheshire by the arm.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShift so we’re a full ninety degrees from Panel One’s angle, closing in over Batman’s shoulder. He’s throwing Cheshire through the glass wall into the boardroom.\n\n1. SFX: KRRRRSSSSH!\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Cheshire. She’s picked up a glass shard from the wall and is spitting on it.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Even her *spit’s* poisoned. This isn’t a fight I can afford to have with a civilian in tow.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman throws down a smoke pellet and begins to turn, pushing Gorman ahead of him down the hallway.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe smoke begins to fill the hall as the poisoned glass shard flies into the cloud.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Batman, I just noticed something.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle of Batman pulling Gorman down a hallway.\n\n1. BATMAN: I’m a little busy right now, Oracle.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) This is important.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHigh angle of the same hallway, empty. The visual is grainy, as through the view of a low-quality camera.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) The security cameras aren’t showing you in the halls.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman and Gorman have reached a door with a plaque next to it saying “GUS GORMAN – CEO.” Batman is turning the doorknob.\n\n1. ORACLE: Comm) That means someone’s looping the footage, which means—\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman has pushed open the office door, revealing a slick but unadorned office. Several cardboard boxes are still stacked in the corner. Standing in front of the safe in the back wall is none other than CATWOMAN.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) —Someone else is in the building.\n\n2. CATWOMAN: … Oops.\n\n3. CAPTION: To be continued!

We see over CATWOMAN’s shoulder as BATMAN and GUS GORMAN burst into Gorman’s office. She’s standing next to Gorman’s open wall safe.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: … Oops.\n\n2. CATWOMAN: (Caption) And this job was going so well, too.\n\n3. TITLE: PANACEA PART II – CAT SCRATCH FEVER\n\n**PAGE TWO – SIX PANELS**\nA large establishing shot, a row of three, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide shot of the METROPOLIS skyline. In the foreground is the S.T.A.R. LABS BUILDING, but the DAILY PLANET BUILDING and LEXCORP TOWER are visible in the distance.\n\n1. CAPTION: Metropolis.\n\n2. CAPTION: Yesterday.\n\n3. CATWOMAN: (Cap) My name is Selina Kyle. I steal things. You could call me a cat burglar.\n\n**Panel Two**\nLow angle from behind SELINA KYLE, who’s wearing a heavy coat with a hood. In the background, S.T.A.R.’s logo is clearly visible.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) Definitely *not* the sort of person *these* nerds like to associate with.\n\n2. CATWOMAN: (Cap) If somebody as squeaky clean as S.T.A.R. wants to hire a thief, they’ve probably got a good cause. I *hate* good causes.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot over Selina’s shoulder as she speaks to an exhausted-looking receptionist who’s looking up from a phone. The last speech bubble overlaps somewhat into Panel Four.\n\n1. SELINA: Tabby Calico, Calico Retrievals. I believe a Doctor *Faulkner* is expecting me?\n\n2. CATWOMAN: (Cap) *Kitty* Faulkner. Almost *too* obvious to be a trap. *Almost.*\n\n3. RECEPTIONIST: Oh, yes, I’ve got you right here. Room 403. Elevators are down the hall to the right.\n\n4. RECEPTIONIST: Sorry about that, Inspector Turpin. You said it was a *blob monster?* Yes, I’ll refer you to the xenobiology department right away.\n\n**Panel Four**\nSelina is walking away from the desk. From this angle, we can see she’s also wearing very large sunglasses, so her face is mostly obscured.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) Case in point for why I hate this city.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThrough a window, we see KITTY FAULKNER’s office. It’s not exactly cluttered, in that the contents do seem to be quite organized, but it’s clear that every available space is being used for something, whether a half-assembled gadget or a stack of incomprehensible scientific notes. Faulkner herself, a mousy, bespectacled woman in her thirties with light brown hair, is in the foreground, staring intensely out the window.\n\n1. SFX: Knock! Knock!\n\n2. FAULKNER: Come in.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe same angle. Selina is leaning in and Faulkner is turning to face her.\n\n1. SELINA: I’m, well, you know.\n\n2. FAULKNER: Yes, I *do.*\n\n3. SELINA: Don’t look so judgmental. You *are* the one hiring me, aren’t you?\n\n**PAGE THREE – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nTwo-shot of Selina and Faulkner sitting down across from each other at the latter’s desk.\n\n1. FAULKNER: I know, it’s just-\n\n2. SELINA: Look. I work fast, quiet, and alone. No fatalities. Payment is half up front and half after. You don’t backstab me, I don’t backstab you. And I’m at least the best *I’ve* ever met. You won’t find a better deal, but if you don’t want it, I’m gone. Won’t even bill you for my bus ticket.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Faulkner, running a hand through her hair.\n\n1. FAULKNER: I guess that’s the best I can hope for. Our… *problem* is Gothcorp. Pharma company. They mostly make generic drugs. Nothing original they’ve rolled out has succeeded and they’re maybe one or two duds away from bankruptcy.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Selina, adjusting her sunglasses. We can just barely see one eyebrow arched behind them.\n\n1. SELINA: But something changed.\n\n2. FAULKNER: (Off-panel) A former colleague of mine in Gothcorp’s R&D division told me they’re rolling out something called “Panacea.” It’s supposedly some kind of miracle cure.\n\n**Panel Four**\nTwo-shot from the side. Selina is expressionless. Faulkner is rubbing her forehead.\n\n1. FAULKNER: Nobody but their top people have any clue where it comes from, what it’s made of, or how it works. According to *my* friend, it *shouldn’t* work. But *somehow* it’s cleared FDA approval with flying colors. If this is some kind of con, people are going to go broke trying to get their hands on it. And with how bad all of this smells, it wouldn’t surprise me if it has side effects.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBack to the closeup on Selina. Her expression is still unreadable.\n\n1. SELINA: So you want me to get you a sample you can reverse-engineer.\n\n2. FAULKNER: Yes.\n\n3. SELINA: Consider it done.\n\n4. CATWOMAN: (Cap) Like I said, I *hate* good causes. I never can resist them, and they *always* get me in trouble.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – FIVE PANELS**\nAn establishing shot and two rows of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nSelina is now outside Gothcorp headquarters in a sleek black dress. VICKI VALE is out of focus in the foreground.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) So that brings enigmatic socialite Selina Kyle to this stuffy function at Gothcorp HQ, trying not to get noticed by reporters.\n\n2. VICKI: Bruce!\n\n3. CATWOMAN: (Cap) Though suddenly, the Fourth Estate seems like the *least* of my problems.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on BRUCE WAYNE, stepping out of his limousine.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) The walking bank account popping out of the limo over there is Bruce Wayne, a notorious airhead. But I’ll let you in on a secret.\n\n2. CATWOMAN: (Cap) He’s Batman.\n\n3. CATWOMAN: (Cap) So if he’s anything like me—and he’s a *lot* more like me than *he’ll* ever admit—he hates these functions.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Selina, frowning and looking shiftily to one side.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) So if he’s here *anyway,* that means he’s expecting trouble. Given that I *am* trouble, I should probably get out of sight before he notices me.\n\n**Panel Four**\nTwo-shot, now inside the atrium. Selina is tapping on a waitress’s shoulder. Those who’ve read the previous issue will recognize her as a disguised VICIOUS.\n\n1. SELINA: You wouldn’t happen to know where the ladies’ room is, would you?\n\n2. VICIOUS: How the hell should I know?\n\n3. SELINA: I’ll, uh, check the back, then.\n\n4. CATWOMAN: (Cap) That was going to be *such* a good excuse to reach the stairwell, too. Not like anyone’s *really* paying attention, but in this business, details are the difference between a paycheck and prison time.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from inside the stairwell of Selina entering. In the background, a well-dressed elderly couple is exiting an elevator, a janitor is entering another, and a flustered-looking waitress is trying to slide across the edge of the stage to get back to the crowd. Gorman is standing at lectern, beginning to speak.\n\n1. GORMAN: I’m so glad you all could make it, and I hope you like… *whatever* it is the hors d’oeuvres are.\n\n2. CATWOMAN: (Cap) Those things *were* pretty fishy-looking.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – FIVE PANELS**\nOne column.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from the top of a flight of stairs as Selina ascends.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) At this point, all that’s left is a bit of cardio…\n\n**Panel Two**\nIn a dark security monitor room, Selina is chloroforming a security guard.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) … Naptime for my friend here…\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on one of the monitors, which is showing a feed of a hallway. The word LOOP has appeared on it.\n\n1 CATWOMAN: (Cap) … A touch of movie magic…\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Selina, still unmasked but now in her costume, rolling up her dress.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) … A quick change of clothes…\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup of Catwoman with her ear to the safe in Gorman’s office.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: (Cap) … And some good old-fashioned safe-cracking. What could *possibly* go wrong?\n\n**PAGE SIX – FOUR PANELS**\nThe borders run diagonally across the page. They’re thick and jagged, resembling claw marks.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe’re back to the present, the same angle as Page One. Batman is pointing at Catwoman, who is looking around for an escape route.\n\n1. BATMAN: Catwoman, get down!\n\n2. CATWOMAN: Sorry, Batman. Not a chance!\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Batman, shoving Gorman to the side.\n\n1. BATMAN: No, I mean—\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman is tackling Catwoman behind Gorman’s desk as PISTOLERA bursts in, firing wildly with two pistols.\n\n1. BATMAN: ***GET DOWN!***\n\n2. CATWOMAN: (Cap) This day just keeps getting better and better.\n\n**Panel Four**\nPistolera shields her eyes from a flashbang thrown by Batman as Gorman runs over behind the desk.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: What now?\n\n2. BATMAN: We have to *fight* our way out.\n\n3. CATWOMAN: Who’s *“we?”*\n\n4. GORMAN: “Who’s we?!” Who’s *you?*\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nAlmost a four-panel grid, but with Panel Three set into the middle.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle on ROBIN, kneeling on a rooftop. He’s lowering a pair of binoculars and drawing a grapnel gun from his utility belt.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Via communicator) This is getting out of hand. Robin, how soon can you reach the office?\n\n2. ROBIN: Fast enough. I’m already on the m- Wait.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup. Robin has raised the binoculars again.\n\n**Panel Three**\nView through the binoculars. We see something small and glowing approaching the top of the tower. At this distance, the shape resembles a lightning bug.\n\n1. ROBIN: (Off-panel) You’ve got incoming, Batman. It looks like…\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on the shape. At this distance, perhaps a better term than “lightning bug” would be FIREFLY.\n\n**Panel Five**\nFirefly is hovering in front of the window on his jetpack. We can see Batman, Catwoman, and Gorman covering behind the desk in the foreground, Pistolera aiming at them in the background, and the other two Ravens, Vicious and Cheshire, closing in further behind her.\n\n1. ROBIN: (Comm) Batman, get *out* of there!\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – SPLASH**\nWe see into the office from just outside the door. The Ravens are diving out of the doorway as a massive burst of FIRE engulfs the room, erupting from Firefly’s flamethrower in the distance.\n\n1. ROBIN: (Comm) It’s Lynns! *Firefly is here!*\n\n**PAGE NINE – SIX PANELS**\nA row of three, a row of two, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide shot of Firefly, starting to fly away.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup. Firefly, hovering again, looks over his shoulder. We see flames reflected in his mask’s lenses.\n\n1. FIREFLY: Hm…\n\n**Panel Three**\nFirefly is flying past a lower floor of the building, sweeping it with his flamethrower.\n\n**Panel Four**\nStill in the hallway. Cheshire is already back on her feet, while Pistolera and Vicious are rising shakily on either side of her. Cheshire’s nose is still visibly broken.\n\n1. VICIOUS: Hey, weren’t the samples in there?\n\n2. CHESHIRE: Nod eddybore. Fide by be.\n\n3. VICIOUS: Huh?\n\n4. CHESHIRE: (SFX: Sigh…)\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from inside the office as Cheshire re-enters.\n\n1. PISTOLERA: So what are we still doing here?\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot over Cheshire’s shoulder. The wall safe is still open. A cable is hanging out the broken window, attached to the desk by a BAT-SHAPED HOOK.\n\n1. CHESHIRE: Cleading ub *looze enns.*\n\n**PAGE TEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot through a shattered window into another office, this one smaller and cheaper than Gorman’s. Batman is kneeling in the foreground, clearly exhausted. Gorman has braced himself in the corner, hyperventilating. Catwoman is picking herself up closest to the door.\n\n1. GORMAN: (SFX) Hih. Hih. Hih.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) (At the top of the panel) This day just keeps getting better and better.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) (By Gorman’s head) Gus Gorman. New Gothcorp CEO. The star of this show.\n\n4. BATMAN: (Cap) (By Catwoman’s head) Selina Kyle. Catwoman. Expert burglar. *Trouble.*\n\n5. BATMAN: (Cap) (At the bottom) We just escaped Garfield Lynns. Firefly. Professional arsonist. Compulsive pyromaniac.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBatman is rising to his feet and turning to face Catwoman, who’s approaching him. She looks genuinely concerned.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: You OK?\n\n2. BATMAN: … Fine.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Catwoman next to the door.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: Well, thanks, Gus.\n\n2. GORMAN: (Off-panel) Me?\n\n**Panel Four**\nExtreme closeup of Catwoman’s hand holding a vial of Panacea.\n\n1. CATWOMAN: For carrying *this* in your pocket. Ciao.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from the hall outside the office. Catwoman is darting out. Batman is starting after her, but stumbling and grabbing his back.\n\n1. BATMAN: Catwoman, *sto-* (SFX: Uhn!)\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Saw right through me. Back hurts. A *lot.*\n\n3. CATWOMAN: (Cap) If he’s still laying on the bravado, he’s good enough to handle himself without *me* sticking around.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup. Batman is looking back out the window.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Forget it. If Selina’s anything like me—and she’s a *lot* more like me than *she’ll* ever admit—she wouldn’t be messing around in corporate espionage without a good reason. Lynns and Cheshire are the more pressing concerns.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of three, a row of two, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nBack in Gorman’s office, we see Cheshire holding Batman’s line, with one foot on the sill of the broken window. Pistolera’s shoulder is in the foreground and Firefly is circling around for another pass in the distance.\n\n1. PISTOLERA: Just a sec, Ches.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from outside. Pistolera is aiming one of her guns out the window.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe same angle. Pistolera fires.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Firefly approaching the building.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle. We see the arc of Pistolera’s bullet clipping through one of the wings of his jetpack.\n\n1. FIREFLY: … Aw, %#@&.\n\n**Panel Six**\nVery wide shot of the building as Firefly spins downward towards the ground.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – SEVEN PANELS**\nA wide shot, a row of three, a row of two, and another wide shot.\n\n**Panel One**\nFirefly arcs down onto a rooftop, skipping across the surface.\n\n**Panel Two**\nFull shot of Firefly lying limp on the ground.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Firefly’s arm as he starts to push himself up.\n\n1. FIREFLY: I…\n\n**Panel Four**\nFirefly has risen to a kneeling position.\n\n1. FIREFLY: I’m alive!\n\n**Panel Five**\nHe gets up and starts to run. His line stretches over into the next panel.\n\n1. FIREFLY: Fuzz ain’t here yet. Just gotta hustle and I’m home frOOF!\n\n**Panel Six**\nFirefly is clotheslined by Robin’s bo staff. \n\n**Panel Seven**\nLow angle on Robin, past Firefly’s unconscious form.\n\n1. ROBIN: Lynns is down.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Comm) Good work. Catwoman got away with a sample-\n\n3. ROBIN: Catwoman?!\n\n4. BATMAN: (Comm) She was our *second* intruder. Keep an eye out for her while I deal with Cheshire. Oracle?\n\n5. ORACLE: (Comm) GCFD is en route. I’ve also got the security cameras up and running.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nCheshire is swinging into the lower office, which is now empty.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Her advantages: Youth, agility, killer instinct, poison, and, maybe, skill.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCheshire proceeds cautiously towards the door. Batman has appeared behind her.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) My advantages: Experience, brute strength, armor, equipment…\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman grabs Cheshire in a chokehold.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) … And *surprise.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nCheshire flails backwards, one of her poisoned claws catching Batman across the cheek.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Not good enough.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman flips Cheshire onto the desk, which breaks.\n\n1. SFX: KRSSSH\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nPanel One is inset in Panel Two, which is full-width. The remaining three panels are in a row at the bottom.\n\n**Panel One**\nCheshire is struggling to her feet in the wreckage of the desk. In the background, we see the edge of Batman’s cape as he ducks out of the room.\n\n**Panel Two**\nFull shot of Batman running down the hall. He doesn’t seem to be moving all that fast.\n\n1. BATMAN: Cheshire scratched me. Getting light-headed already.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) You need backup? I have Nightwing on standby.\n\n3. BATMAN: No time for that. What I *need* is a *plan.*\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from inside a darkened conference room. Batman has thrown open the door.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Hopefully, Cheshire is chasing me and not looking for Gorman.\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle. We see Batman’s cape sweeping through the door of the conference room in the background. In the foreground, Cheshire’s fist is reaching down into view.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) This looks like a reasonable hiding place.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Cheshire as she bursts into the conference room.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – EIGHT PANELS**\nA row of one, three rows of two, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nPull out. Batman’s cape *is* in the room, but is attached only to a rolling chair and not to its owner. Behind Cheshire, the door is slamming shut.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Which is exactly what I *want* it to look like.\n\n2. SFX: SLAM!\n\n3. SFX: Click!\n\n**Panel Two**\nCheshire is turning to look at a phone on the table.\n\n1. SFX: Rrrring! Rrrring!\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup. Cheshire is cautiously picking up the phone.\n\n1. ORACLE: (From the phone) Cheshire. Professional assassin and international terrorist. Real name, Jade Nguyen – or… do you prefer Jade *Pullman?*\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle. Cheshire looks *very* surprised.\n\n1. CHESHIRE: Wha-?\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle. Cheshire looks *very* angry.\n\n1. CHESHIRE: *Oraggle.*\n\n2. ORACLE: (Phone) Good guess. By the way, you plan on doing something about that nose?\n\n**Panel Six**\nCheshire is kneeling by the door, staring at the lock.\n\n1. CHESHIRE: Lader. Kill yer frenn firs.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Phone) In that case, maybe it’s better if I talk and you listen.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nA very grainy view through a window of a grungy, run-down building. It appears to be a hotel. A briefcase is lying on the bed.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Phone) Right now, I’m looking at a feed of the Blatt Street Bed and Breakfast. *Very* generously sized suitcase on the bed in Room 203.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Phone) If that were full of money, and it were my money, I’d want to get back there fast. You know, before the police confiscate it. Did I mention them?\n\n**Panel Eight**\nShot from outside as Cheshire kicks the door open.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Phone) Not a whole lot of time for killing, is there?\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Batman, sans cape. He’s slumped against a wall.\n\n1. BATMAN: Smooth work. I was just… hoping to buy time.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) I can still get one of ours on her tail.\n\n3. BATMAN: No. Too… too dangerous. Deal… myself… later.\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) You’re not in much condition to deal with *anything.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nLow angle. Batman has risen to his feet. His teeth are gritted and his fists are balled, but his stance is weak.\n\n1. BATMAN: Not. Done. Yet.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Gorman. He’s hiding in a supply closet, trying to brace the door closed.\n\n1. PISTOLERA: (Through the door) Any idea which way they went?\n\n2. VICIOUS: (Through the door) Yes, Bunny, my *psychic powers* let me magically home in on crazy people in animal costumes.\n\n3. PISTOLERA: (Through the door) I was just *ask-* Hey, did you hear that?\n\n4. VICIOUS: (Through the door) Hear what?\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle, Gorman now looks more curious than scared.\n\n1. SFX: Thud! Whumpf! Krak!\n\n**Panel Five**\nOutside. Similar angle to Panel Two, but now Batman is standing over Pistolera and Vicious, who are unconscious.\n\n1. BATMAN: Now… *Now* I’m done.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh, distant shot of Robin running across a rooftop.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Robin, Batman needs to get back to the Cave *now.*\n\n2. ROBIN: Wait, I just spotted-\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot over Robin’s shoulder. He’s looking down at a lower roof. There, we see Catwoman, sitting against an air conditioning unit. She no longer has the Panacea sample, and her hand is FROZEN to the unit in a chunk of ice.\n\n1. ROBIN: -Catwoman?\n\n**Panel Three**\nRobin is landing in front of Catwoman.\n\n1. ROBIN: Wait, wait, let me guess. The Mad Hatter did this.\n\n2. CATWOMAN: C-cute.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Catwoman, scowling (and shivering).\n\n1. CATWOMAN: M-Mister F-Freeze has the s-sample!\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over the top of the BAT-SIGNAL. Batman and COMMISSIONER GORDON are talking on the roof of GOTHAM CITY POLICE HEADQUARTERS.\n\n1. BATMAN: Afterwards, we confirmed that the dosage of the toxin wasn’t lethal.\n\n2. GORDON: Catwoman turned out all right too. Well enough to disappear from her hospital room before we could get an ID on her.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Batman. He’s folded his arms and is facing out towards the city. We can see Gordon looking at him in the background.\n\n1. BATMAN: So that just leaves Freeze.\n\n2. GORDON: Not to mention sorting out who *hired* everyone. “Pistolera” and “Vicious” aren’t turning up any real names, and they insist only Cheshire knew who their employer was.\n\n3. BATMAN: And *Lynns?*\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe same angle. Gordon has turned away. Batman is already stepping forward off the roof.\n\n1. GORDON: Lynns says he was approached through a contact at…\n\n**Panel Four**\nHigh angle, showing the layout of BLACKGATE PENITENTIARY at night.\n\n1. GORDON: (Cap) … Blackgate.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – EIGHT PANELS**\nTwo-by-four grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on FERRIS BOYLE, wearing a prison uniform and lying on a cot.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Ferris Boyle. Former CEO of Gothcorp.\n\n**Panel Two**\nA shadow falls over him.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Off-panel) Don’t move.\n\n2. BOYLE: Wasn’t especially planning on it.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from Boyle’s POV. He looks over to see Batman’s silhouette looming in the darkness.\n\n1. BATMAN: You hired Firefly to torch your own company’s headquarters.\n\n2. BOYLE: I did.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Batman, raising an eyebrow.\n\n1. BATMAN: You *admit* it?\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Boyle. He’s leaning up a little and shrugging.\n\n1. BOYLE: What are you gonna do? Throw me in prison *more?*\n\n2. BATMAN: (Off-panel) Why?\n\n3. BOYLE: Why else? Spite Gorman. Smug @$$#@+.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBack to the closeup of Batman.\n\n1. BATMAN: Then you don’t know why Freeze is involved?\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) It was Boyle’s attempt to shut down Victor Fries’ cryogenic experiments on his terminally ill wife that turned Fries into “Mister Freeze” in the first place. If they both made a play for Panacea at the same time, there *could* be a connection.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nBoyle again. For the first time, he looks surprised and a little afraid.\n\n1. BOYLE: Freeze? That psycho is in this?!\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) This confirms what I already suspected.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nBack to the angle on Batman, except Batman himself isn’t there anymore.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) If Freeze wasn’t there for revenge on Boyle…\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SPLASH**\nWe see a room that looks somewhere between a freezer and a laboratory. It is most prominently taken up by a large cryogenic stasis tank, in which we can just make out the silhouette of NORA FRIES. In the foreground, MISTER FREEZE is holding up the vial of Panacea, staring at it intently.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) … He must have thought Panacea could save *Nora.*\n\n2.

COMMISSIONER GORDON ascends the front steps, pursued by HARVEY BULLOCK, who is brandishing a half-eaten jelly doughnut in one hand while coffee sloshes out of a cup with an improperly secured lid in the other. It’s night, and pouring rain.\n\n1. BULLOCK: Commish! Wait up!\n\n**PAGE TWO – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nGordon holds the door for Bullock, who is still gesticulating with the doughnut. Gordon recoils slightly from the soggy pastry.\n\n1. BULLOCK: Coroner got back to me on that homicide down by Crime Alley.\n\n2. GORDON: Learn anything?\n\n3. BULLOCK: Nothin’ good.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Bullock.\n\n1. BULLOCK: See, he figured there was somethin’ funny about the way the victim was cut up.\n\n2. BULLOCK: Turns out he was *butchered.* And I mean, we knew that, but I’m talkin’ about butchered as in the same cuts you’d take outta a cow to make burgers ‘n steaks.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Gordon, glancing around.\n\n1. GORDON: We shouldn’t be having this conversation in the lobby.\n\n2. BULLOCK: (Off-panel) I *hear* ya, Commish. Thought you’d wanna know.\n\n3. GORDON: Right, right.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThey’ve moved over to the elevators.\n\n1. GORDON: (Whispering) So we’re looking for a cannibal?\n\n2. BULLOCK: (Whispering) Uh, maybe worse than that. See, later the same night, there was a break-in at a deli three blocks from the scene. Lock broken, no other security, but the owner reported nothin’ missing.\n\n3. GORDON: (Whispering) My God. Are you saying-?\n\n4. BULLOCK: (Whispering) Can’t say for sure, but it’s lookin’ that way.\n\n5. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) HELP ME!\n\n**PAGE THREE – THREE PANELS**\nA large splash and a row of two at the bottom.\n\n**Panel One**\nFull shot of a woman bursting through the door. She’s in her mid-twenties, with long, blonde hair. She’s wearing a white T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants. Both look a size or two too large for her and the shirt is a men’s style. She’s barefoot and soaked.\n\n1. MYSTERY WOMAN: *Please!* He might have *followed* me!\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot framed between Bullock and Gordon. A couple uniformed officers are approaching the mystery woman.\n\n1. BULLOCK: (Whispering) *On* something, you think?\n\n2. GORDON: (Whispering) In this town, you never know.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe woman takes a swing at one of the officers, who’s jumping back in surprise.\n\n1. MYSTERY WOMAN: ***Stay back!***\n\n**PAGE FOUR – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nShe steps back, looking at her hand in surprise.\n\n1. MYSTERY WOMAN: I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean… I…\n\n**Panel Two**\nGordon steps into the frame, extending a hand carefully.\n\n1. GORDON: We can help you, but I’d like to know more. *Who* might’ve followed you?\n\n2. MYSTERY WOMAN: M-my husband. He’s… dangerous. K-killed people.\n\n**Panel Three**\nTwo-shot. Gordon is taking off his coat.\n\n1. GORDON: You look cold.\n\n2. MYSTERY WOMAN: F-freezing. Heh.\n\n**Panel Four**\nGordon drapes the coat over her shoulders and begins to walk her towards the elevators. She still looks scared, but she’s already calmed down a lot.\n\n1. MYSTERY WOMAN: Sorry about the d-dramatic entrance. D-don’t know what c-came over me.\n\n2. GORDON: Happens more often than you’d think. What’s your name?\n\n**PAGE FIVE – SPLASH**\nExtreme closeup on Mystery Woman.\n\n1. MYSTERY WOMAN: Nora. My name is *Nora Fries.*\n\n**PAGE SIX – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of one with an inset, a row of two, and another row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nGordon is sitting across from Nora in his office. She’s still wrapped in his coat. She’s holding a paper cup full of coffee, but her posture suggests she’s using it more to warm her hands than to drink.\n\n1. NORA: I… take it I don’t have to explain who I am.\n\n2. GORDON: I’m afraid not.\n\n3. NORA: Hell of a way to become a celebrity.\n\n4. GORDON: But… I do have to ask: Are you still…\n\n5. NORA: Dying? As I understand it, no.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Gordon, his brow furrowed.\n\n1. GORDON: The stolen Panacea sample. So it really works, then?\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot over Gordon’s shoulder, focused on Nora.\n\n1. NORA: Um, sort of. It… does and doesn’t? I mean-\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) Maybe you should start from the beginning.\n\n**Panel Four**\nNora is jumping to her feet, a shocked expression on her face. Gordon is turning in her seat, not fazed at all.\n\n1. NORA: My God!\n\n2. GORDON: It’s about *time* you showed up.\n\n**Panel Five**\nFull shot of BATMAN, standing in front of Gordon’s window.\n\n1. BATMAN: Ran into Magpie working over a jewelry store on the way over. I handed her over to Bullock on the roof.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid. Each row is a little taller than the last.\n\n**Panel One**\nNora is backing away, her expression frantic.\n\n1. NORA: You- You’re- You’re…\n\n**Panel Two**\nTwo-shot of Gordon and Batman. Gordon has risen slightly and is gesturing in Nora’s direction with one hand and at Batman with the other. Batman, for once, is deliberately stepping *into* the light.\n\n1. GORDON: Sorry about the startle. He’ll do that. This is-\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Shaking. Pupils dilated. *More* than panic.\n\n**Panel Three**\nWe’re looking between Gordon and Batman as Nora bolts out the door. Batman turns to Gordon.\n\n1. GORDON: Wait!\n\n2. BATMAN: Maybe *you* should explain.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from behind Nora as she runs down the hallway towards a surprised-looking middle-aged blonde woman.\n\n**Panel Five**\nNora takes a swing at the woman, who is ducking.\n\n1. NORA: ***AAH!***\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe woman has Nora in an arm lock.\n\n1. NORA: *Ughn!*\n\n2. POLICEWOMAN: I know the Commissioner can be frustrating, but this is a *little* much* don’t you think?\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nFrom inside Gordon’s office. He’s looking out the door, while Batman hasn’t moved.\n\n1. BATMAN: You’re *certain* it’s her?\n\n2. GORDON: You know what I know.\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe older woman is walking down the hallway with a suddenly much more cooperative Nora. We’re looking over Gordon’s shoulder.\n\n1. POLICEWOMAN: *Lose* something, Jim?\n\n2. GORDON: Sarah!\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Sarah Essen. Head of Major Crimes. Jim’s second wife.\n\n4. SARAH: Your friend here has a mean right hook.\n\n5. NORA: I’m sorry, Captain Essen. I don’t know why I… I just don’t know.\n\n**Panel Three**\nNora reenters the office next to Gordon. Sarah is standing outside with her arms folded. Batman is in the foreground.\n\n1. NORA: Are you… *really* him?\n\n2. BATMAN: Yes.\n\n3. NORA: Wow. Wasn’t even sure you *existed* when I… you know.

Between the second and third rows is the TITLE.\n\n1. TITLE: PANACEA PART III – WOMEN IN REFRIGERATORS\n\n**Panel One**\nNora is sitting down in an open cryo tank. VICTOR is holding her hand. We see a high-tech lab in the background.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) It started a few weeks ago.\n\n2. NORA: How can you (SFX: koff) possibly be *certain* you can find a cure?\n\n3. VICTOR: I could and *would* do *anything* for you.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Nora. She’s putting on a brave face and trying to smile.\n\n1. NORA: I… believe you.\n\n**Panel Three**\nNora’s POV. The tank is closing. Victor is looking concernedly down at her. The ceiling is a fairly typical drop ceiling.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle. The tank is closed.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBlack.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) I didn’t really feel the passage of time. Just a distant sense of being very, very cold.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe same angle as Panels Three and Four. The tank is opening again. The ceiling is metal, with exposed rafters.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) Then suddenly…\n\n**Panel Seven**\nCloseup on Nora. She’s struggling to sit up. She’s yelling, a manic expression somewhere between rage and terror on her face. There’s a distinct green glint in her eyes.\n\n1. NORA: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\n2. NORA: (Cap) … I was *burning.*\n\n**Panel Eight**\nMISTER FREEZE has Nora in a bear hug. She’s struggling, largely ineffectually. He looks shocked.\n\n1. FREEZE: Nora! Nora, it’s *me!*\n\n**PAGE TEN – THREE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup of Nora looking at Freeze.\n\n1. NORA: V-victor?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Freeze.\n\n1.

Thank you.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nNora and Freeze are sitting across from each other at a cheap folding table. It’s almost like a dinner scene, but he can’t eat anything because he basically has a fish bowl on his head, and Nora doesn’t have anything but a very large metal tumbler with a straw. They’re in a large, empty room.\n\n1. NORA: I’m… I’m sorry. I don’t know what… what that was.\n\n2. FREEZE: No. No apologies. Now that you’re m- we’re together again, we’ll never have to apologize again.\n\n3. NORA: But… how *long* has it been? Why are you dressed like that?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Freeze.\n\n1. FREEZE: It’s been… almost ten years.\n\n2. NORA: (Cap) He told me *some* of what had happened. Boyle, the accident, some of the cures he’d tried. A *little* about, well, *you,* Batman. Not much about *himself,* of course.\n\n**Panel Three**\nNora has overturned the table and is clawing at Freeze’s helmet.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) I didn’t take it well.\n\n2. NORA: (Cap) Of course, he wears a powered exo-suit and my muscles have been atrophying for ten years, so I was a bigger danger to myself than to Victor.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same room without the table. Instead, a few handrails are set up as Nora struggles to walk towards Freeze.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) *That,* by the way, was his excuse for keeping me locked away. “Physical therapy.” His freezing process preserved a lot of the muscle mass, but I’m sort of… numb, and clumsy.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nAn old photograph of Victor and Nora. They’re posing with their arms around each other in front of a Christmas tree, wearing ugly sweaters.\n\n1.

Just… just like *I* should’ve been.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot past a computer monitor. Freeze is frowning at it in the foreground. In the background, Nora is strapped to a cot, struggling and yelling. Some equipment is hooked up to her.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) But I didn’t trust my instincts. I was still having *episodes.* Just like you saw. Victor began to suspect they were caused by the formula he’d used to cure me.\n\n**Panel Four**\nNora points at Freeze. She looks angry, but clear-headed. We still see the cot and the monitor in the background.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) Finally, I worked up the nerve to put my foot down.\n\n2. NORA: Where *are* we, Victor? Why haven’t I seen anyone but you?

ARTICLE TEXT: GOTHAM CITY, NJ – An attempted robbery by wanted felon Victor Fries turned violent this morning when police arrived on the scene. “Mister Freeze” appeared unexpectedly at Mishkin Jewelers, threatening staff and patrons with a cryonic cannon. A witness passing by outside the store saw the situation and called the GCPD, prompting an unusually swift response from Gotham’s finest.\n\n4. ARTICLE TEXT: “Normally, our procedure with Fries is to try negotiating,” says Detective Renee Montoya, “He’s not insane like your typical Arkham inmate. He steals to fund medical care for his wife, and he won’t do anything stupid to jeopardize that.”—Continued on Page 3.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nMedium shot. Nora has rises to her feet, horrified.\n\n1. NORA: Killed…? For *me?*\n\n2. NORA: How- Oh, Vic, how *could* you? How…\n\n**Panel Two**\nShe’s snarling, rearing back with a tightly-curled fist. Her eyes are a little greener.\n\n1. NORA: … ***DARE*** YOU?!\n\n**Panel Three**\nNora overturns the desk, yelling in rage.\n\n1. NORA: Victor, you ***&@$#@%^!***\n\n**Panel Four**\nShe collapses to her knees, flailing in desperate outrage at the already-broken monitor.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShe holds her head in her hands.\n\n1. NORA: Not for *me,* Vic… Not in *my* name.\n\n2. NORA: (Small font) Why not just let me *die?*\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SEVEN PANELS**\nTwo rows of three and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nNora rises shakily to her feet, looking around worriedly.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) I knew he was *different,* but that was when I realized I might really be in danger.\n\n**Panel Two**\nNora pulls on the doorknob, to no effect.\n\n1. NORA: Locked from the outside. Damn it, damn it, damn it.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from inside another room. Nora is rushing in through an open door.\n\n1. NORA: Got to find something to…\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot over her shoulder. This room contains her pod.\n\n1. NORA: … Get me out.\n\n2. NORA: (Cap) I’m a research biochemist, not a cryogenicist…\n\n**Panel Five**\nShe’s opened a panel on the pod and is pulling out a handful of wires and pipes.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) … But I’d seen enough of Victor’s work to rig up a basic freeze ray.\n\n**Panel Six**\nNora has wheeled the pod into the room with the computer. She’s unhooked a pipe from the pod and is pointing it at the doorknob while holding down a switch on the pod with her other hand. Icy wind blasts out as frost forms across the surface of the door.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) … What? Why are you looking at me like that?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nNora, using the pod as a battering ram, smashes the door open.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – THREE PANELS**\nA wide but short panel on top, a splash, and a large inset.\n\n**Panel One**\nShe emerges onto a tall hill overlooking the islands of Gotham. It’s raining and the wind blows her hair around wildly.\n\n**Panel Two**\nLow, wide angle, showing that we’ve been in an abandoned observatory. Lightning cracks in the background.\n\n1. NORA: (Cap) There were more convenient places to go for help, but I just wasn’t thinking clearly. We’d worked only a couple blocks from Police Headquarters, and that was where I thought to go.\n\n**Panel Three**\nNora is stumbling down a muddy path. Very distant in the background, we see Freeze looking into the open door of the observatory.\n\n1. FREEZE: Nora! NOOOORAAAA!!!\n\n2. NORA: (Cap) And I really did think he might’ve followed me.\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA splash with an inset and a row of three along the bottom.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe’re looking back at Gordon’s office through the window. Batman is in the foreground, looking out the window dramatically, as he is wont to do. Gordon is beginning to rise from his desk. Nora is still sitting across from him. Sarah is leaning in the doorway with her arms folded. Batman has removed a small device from his belt buckle.\n\n1. NORA: … And that’s all I know.\n\n2. GORDON: Thank you, Mrs. Fries. I, uh, need to make some phone calls.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on the device in Batman’s hands. It’s like a little mini-smartphone with a chat feature open. At the bottom we see a few buttons, including a speech bubble, a wheel with a bat-symbol on the hubcap, and an image of a cave. The speech bubble is highlighted. At the top is Oracle’s symbol and a “back” button.\n\n**Batman:** Listen cowl mic if poss\n\n**Oracle:** I’m in.\n-1m-\n**Oracle:** OMG, is this who I think it is?\n\n**Batman:** Yes\n-15m-\n**Oracle:** He’s going to call me and make sure I haven’t used Panacea. Be in touch in a few.\n\n**Oracle:** I see you typing. No, I haven’t.\n\n**Batman:** :heavy_check_mark:\n\n**Panel Three**\nWe move over to the other side of the room, now looking past Sarah at Nora and Batman. Batman is turning back to face them.\n\n1. BATMAN: I assume the Department can offer you protection if you want it.\n\n2. SARAH: Of course.\n\n3. NORA: God, I guess I need it. Can’t believe…\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Batman, sitting down in Gordon’s chair across from Nora.\n\n1. BATMAN: Your husband’s mental state has… *deteriorated* over time. This might push him to do something dangerous.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Nora, looking up grimly at Batman.\n\n1. NORA: You’re asking me to help catch him.\n\n2. BATMAN: He-\n\n3. NORA: I’ll do it.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh angle on a concrete building with small, barred windows. It’s still night. The rain, if anything, has only intensified, beating mercilessly against the cityscape below.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (From inside) And I assume your client *realizes* that we can’t drop the charges entirely, of course. Maybe a couple of the counts with flimsier evidence turn into possession instead of dealing, and we talk to Judge Reilly about going easy on sentencing.\n\n2. UNKNOWN 2: (Inside) Yeah, I get the picture.\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe’re inside a cramped meeting room. In the foreground, a pair of silhouetted figures, one seated and one standing, look over paperwork in front of them. In the background, CHELSEA MCKAY has her hands folded on the table and one eyebrow raised, while VIC CLARENCE leans against the wall next to the door, looking bored.\n\n1. STANDING FIGURE: This is awfully generous, Ms. McKay.\n\n2. CHELSEA: I *hope* it isn’t, but… I guess that sort of depends on what you can give us in return, doesn’t it?\n\n3. SEATED FIGURE: Yeah, I’ll talk.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe reverse of the previous shot. Chelsea and Vic are now in silhouette and we see a scruffy-looking middle-aged man in a t-shirt sitting and a nervous-looking younger man in a dress shirt standing.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Let’s start with the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question.\n\n2. CRIMINAL: Huh?\n\n3. CHELSEA: Never mind. Who do you work for?\n\n4. CRIMINAL: Oh, uh, sure.\n\n5. LAWYER: Are you *certain* you want to-\n\n6. CRIMINAL: I work for Arnold Wesker. The Ventriloquist.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Chelsea, frowning. On anyone else, it would be a terrifying glare, but her round face and large glasses make her look more like an angry chipmunk.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Can I have a moment to talk to my co-counsel?\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of four and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nChelsea and Vic are standing out in a better-lit hallway. A police officer standing guard outside the room is looking at them with mild curiosity.\n\n1. VIC: What’s the deal?\n\n2. CHELSEA: He’s lying. Weren’t you paying attention?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Vic, shrugging.\n\n1. VIC: Not really. If I wanted to haggle over contracts, I’d have gone into transactions.\n\n**Panel Three**\nChelsea brandishes a manila folder.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Wesker’s people *never* say they work for Wesker. It’s always the doll, *Scarface.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nVic again.\n\n1. VIC: Pacino, huh? I dig it. But what’s your point?\n\n**Panel Five**\nTwo-shot. Chelsea runs a hand through her hair.\n\n1. CHELSEA: I’ll let the fact that you didn’t say Paul Muni slide. The point is that’s why they *call* him the Ventriloquist. He does everything through the dummy, and he’ll *kill* you for talking to, uh, himself.\n\n2. VIC: So? This guy isn’t selling the company line. What makes you smell a rat?\n\n3. CHELSEA: I don’t. I smell a *Penguin.*\n\n**Panel Six**\nVic is looking around nervously.\n\n1. VIC: Don’t even *say* that name. The walls have *ears* in a place like this. What’s your issue, anyway?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nCloseup on Chelsea. Her expression is more even, her eyes obscured by Vic’s reflection in her glasses.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Personal grudge. I admit that. But I *know* how he works.\n\n2. VIC: Well you should *forget.* Nobody takes down somebody *that* big, and I *don’t* mean his weight.\n\n3. CHELSEA: … *Almost* nobody.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – THREE PANELS**\nA row of two and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nA high angle on GCPD headquarters. The edge of Batman’s cape blows into the frame.\n\n1. BATMAN: You were *right* about Panacea, Oracle.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Via communicator) You sure? Nora’s been through a lot. This could be all her. And it certainly *did* the job.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Batman, one eyebrow raised.\n\n1. BATMAN: You were the skeptic from the beginning.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Hey, can’t be disappointed if you don’t… get your hopes up, right?\n\n3. BATMAN: It gets worse. I *know* what Panacea is. Should’ve guessed before, but I thought it *couldn’t* be.\n\n**Panel Three**\nTighter closeup. Batman is staring grimly directly at the reader.\n\n1. BATMAN: But I’ve seen Nora’s symptoms before, and so have you.\n\n2. BATMAN: It’s *Pit Madness.* They bottled the *Lazarus Pits.*\n\n3. CAPTION: Next time: OMEGA!\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid with the title in the middle.\n\n**Panel One**\nA thin man, about thirty years old with a mustache, runs down the hall of a hospital, with a worried expression on his face.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHe bursts into a hospital room. We see over his shoulder. A young man, about fourteen years old, is in the bed, covered in bruises, including a prominent black eye. He’s hooked up to an IV. He has a wry smirk on his face.\n\n1. BRUCE: … Hey, Alfred.\n\n2. CAPTION: Gotham, twenty-five years ago.\n\n3. TITLE: BRUCE\n\n4. TITLE: Chapter I – Shadow of the Cat\n\n5. TITLE: Part I – Bad Decisions\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on ALFRED, gasping.\n\n1. ALFRED: Master Bruce! What happened here?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on BRUCE. His expression has turned grim.\n\n1. BRUCE: I, uh, lost.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-THREE – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce, pre-beating, is walking down a Gotham street. It looks like a pretty rough neighborhood and he’s tugging uncomfortably at the collar of his dress shirt.\n\n1. BRUCE: (Cap) I was, uh, looking for a Big Belly Burger a couple blocks from school.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot over his shoulder. He’s looking at an alleyway.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (From inside the alley) Gimme the cash!\n\n2. UNKNOWN 2: (From inside the alley) I don’t have anything, man!\n\n**Panel Three**\nExtreme closeup. Bruce’s hand has tightened into a fist, his knuckles whitening with tension.\n\n**Panel Four**\nWe’re inside the alley. Two men are holding another at knifepoint. The victim is just in a sweatshirt and jeans, not particularly *badly* dressed but it doesn’t exactly scream “money” either. The muggers are skinny, wearing ratty clothes, and looking around nervously. It’s a safe bet this is the first time they’ve done this, but they look pretty desperate. Bruce is standing in the background, backlit by sunlight.\n\n1. BRUCE: You two should probably move on.\n\n2. MUGGER 1: *Us* move on? What’re you talkin’ about, kid?\n\n**Panel Five**\nBruce is punching the mugger across the face. Let’s get a Dutch angle, a flashy background, and a bunch of motion lines. It looks *dramatic.*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-FOUR – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Mugger 1, completely unfazed. Mugger 2 has his arms folded in the background.\n\n**Panel Two**\nMugger 1 touches his face, a little confused.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe two look over their shoulder to see the victim running out the other side of the alley.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThey look back towards Bruce.\n\n1. MUGGER 2: Screw him. This kid looks rich anyway.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-FIVE – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Bruce, back in the hospital bed.\n\n1. BRUCE: … And then they beat me up.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Alfred, somewhere between angry and horrified.\n\n1. ALFRED: *Well.* I *hope* you’ve *learned* something from this, Master Bruce.\n\n2. BRUCE: (Off-panel) Yeah…\n\n**Panel Three**\nBack to Bruce. He’s making a fist.\n\n1. BRUCE: … I need to learn how to fight.\n\n**Panel Four**\nAlfred, facepalming.\n\n1. ALFRED: (Whispering) Forgive me, Master Thomas. I don’t know *where* I went wrong.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-SIX – FIVE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup. We’re looking at a middle-aged-to-older man, maybe in his early ‘50s, with salt-and-pepper hair and greying temples. He’s getting punched across the jaw from the left. The attacker is wearing a dark green boxing glove and the man getting punched is wearing a black boxing helmet.\n\n1. BOXER IN BLACK: Uhn!\n\n**Panel Two**\nZoom out. We’re looking at a BOXING RING. The boxer in black is facing off against the boxer in green. The boxer in green is also older, with greying blond hair, and good foot-and-a-half taller than the boxer in black. Both of them are well-muscled, especially for their age. The boxer in black is feinting with a right hook that the boxer in green easily parries.\n\n1. BOXER IN BLACK: That the best you can do, Scott?\n\n2. SCOTT: That *must’ve* at least *hurt,* Ted.\n\n**Panel Three**\nTwo-shot. TED GRANT follows with a left-handed uppercut that sends ALAN SCOTT reeling.\n\n1. TED: *This* is hurt!\n\n2. ALAN: Oof!\n\n**Panel Four**\nAlan is sprawled on the floor. Ted is reaching down to help him up.\n\n1. ALAN: A *left,* too. I thought *I* was the southpaw.\n\n2. TED: That’s why you keep leaving your right *open,* you goon.\n\n**Panel Five**\nAnother two-shot. Alan chugs from a water bottle while Ted takes his gloves off. Alan is glaring at Ted, unable to verbalize the witty retort in his head.\n\n1. TED: You’re hopeless, Alan. I’ve been trying to teach you to fight for *decades.*\n\n2. SFX: (Off-panel) Ring!\n\n3. TED: … At *this* hour?\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nTed is approaching a desk at the front of what we can now see is a large gym. Bruce is at the desk. He’s learned a little from his last encounter and is now in a T-shirt and jeans.\n\n1. TED: Little *late* for customers, kid.\n\n2. BRUCE: Should I come back?\n\n3. TED: Hell, I don’t care. I do my best work at night.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot over Ted’s shoulder at Bruce.\n\n1. BRUCE: The sign says you offer boxing lessons.\n\n2. TED: You believe *everything* you read, kid?\n\n3. ALAN: (Off-panel) Cut him some slack, Ted.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot between Bruce and Ted at Alan, who’s now in a wrinkled dress shirt, and has a gym bag slung over his shoulder. He’s pointing at his watch.\n\n1. ALAN: I’m cutting out. Probably gonna be late for my flight as it is.\n\n2. TED: Tell Jay his hat is ugly for me.\n\n3. ALAN: Glass houses, Whiskers.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Ted. He’s looking back at Bruce and scratching his stubble.\n\n1. TED: Wanna learn how to fight, huh?\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle. His expression has turned more serious.\n\n1. TED: Why?\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-EIGHT – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Bruce. He’s a little taken aback.\n\n1. BRUCE: I’m sorry?\n\n2. TED: (Off-panel) Did I stutter?\n\n**Panel Two**\nBack to Ted, counting off on his fingers.\n\n1. TED: Are you looking to beat on somebody in particular? Compete? Get ripped? Defend yourself? Impress chicks?\n\n**Panel Three**\nBruce is scratching his head.\n\n1. BRUCE: I, uh… I mean, it’s sort of personal.\n\n**Panel Four**\nWide shot. Ted is leaning on the counter.\n\n1. TED: It’s *always* personal, kid. So let’s hear it.\n\n2. BRUCE: I…\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-NINE – TWO PANELS**\nSplash with an inset in the lower right corner.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe shot. You know the one. The one with Eight-Year-Old Bruce on his knees in Crime Alley and the pearls, his eyes “wide with terror and shock as the horrible scene is spread before him.” The one every single Batman writer feels compelled to show you at least once. Well, here’s my submission.\n\n1. BRUCE: (Cap) My parents were murdered in a mugging. I watched it happen.\n\n2. BRUCE: Father… Mother!\n\n3. BRUCE: … Dead! They’re d-dead!\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Bruce in the present.\n\n1. BRUCE: And I… I just thought that if I could have… *stopped* it, somehow.

GORDON: (Off-panel) I’m getting too old for this.\n\n**PAGE THREE – SEVEN PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nCOMMISSIONER JAMES GORDON is standing in the foreground, lit by the signal off to the side. Batman is on the edge of the roof in the background, still in silhouette.\n\n1. BATMAN: We all are, Jim.\n\n2. GORDON: Hmph. And here I was starting to *buy* the rumors that you’re immortal.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Caption) James Gordon. Police Commissioner. My friend.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Batman stepping into the light. The expression on his face doesn’t quite rise to the level of a smile, but is at least more pleasantly neutral than usual.\n\n1. BATMAN: No such luck. Why the Signal? Did you locate any of the Arkham escapees*?\n\n2. CAPTION: *A mass breakout happened in the smash DCW: Alpha oneshot! Where were you? - SelfEditingJamags\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Jim lighting his pipe.\n\n1. GORDON: Don’t count yourself out just yet. Call came in from the CEO of *Gothcorp*, of all people.\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle of Batman and Jim.\n\n1. BATMAN: The new one. Gorman?\n\n2. GORDON: The same. He tells me Gothcorp is rolling out some kind of miracle drug. He was cagey with the details, but to hear him talk you’d think it turns lead into gold and donkeys into unicorns.\n\n3. BATMAN: Smells like a con.\n\n4. GORDON: Probably *is*. But Gorman seems to think that after the public announcement, someone will try to steal it. That’s where *you* come in.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup of Batman, one eyebrow raised.\n\n1. BATMAN: So I’m playing watchdog for a phony drug? *Now,* of all times?\n\n**Panel Six**\nJim turns to gesture at a skyscraper in the distance with “Gothcorp” written across the side in large neon letters.\n\n1. GORDON: Thought you should at least hear about it. I’m more worried about what happens if one of our escapees hits their headquarters. Besides, if it *is* all a fraud, you can—\n\n**Panel Seven**\nJim turns back towards Batman and he’s gone.\n\n1. GORDON: —Every damn time.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle on the Batmobile driving down a Gotham street, splashing water up towards the reader. Dawn is beginning to peek through the clouds in the background.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) I’ve been watching Gorman ever since I helped land his predecessor in prison.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) He’s invited Bruce Wayne—and about half the reporters and socialites in Gotham—to a reception at Gothcorp International Headquarters in the Diamond District of Old Gotham. He’s set to make a major announcement.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Unless I miss my guess, Jim’s just spoiled the big surprise for me.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShow the Batmobile pulling into the cave’s entrance from inside, a red-and-white striped roadblock rising back into place in the background outside.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman is exiting the Batmobile. ALFRED is dusting the Bat-Computer in the background.\n\n1. ALFRED: I trust tonight’s adventures were suitably violent, Master Bruce?\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Alfred Pennyworth. Family Butler. He raised me after my parents’ death.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Batman removing his mask to reveal BRUCE WAYNE.\n\n1. BRUCE: Just a few second-story men. No trouble.\n\n2. ALFRED: (Off-panel) My condolences, sir.\n\n**Panel Two**\nAlfred folds his arms and gives his best disapproving stare.\n\n1. ALFRED: And might I ask what urgent matter brings you to your ancestral home at five in the morning?\n\n**Panel Three**\nBruce is hanging up his cape and belt.\n\n1. BRUCE: Actually, I thought I might catch up on some sleep so I can attend a social function.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Alfred, one eyebrow raised skeptically.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle.\n\n1. ALFRED: Are you *certain* you’re *entirely* all right, sir?\n\n**PAGE SIX – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nEstablishing shot of a municipal-looking building, with copious columns and relief sculptures. It’s daytime. A small figure is ascending its front steps.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over the shoulder of DEREK ALTMAN, a balding, overweight man in a suit, looking down the steps at CHELSEA MCKAY, a twenty-something woman, about four feet tall, in an overcoat with round, monolithically large glasses. A resemblance to Velma Dinkley would not be entirely coincidental.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Sorry to keep you waiting. Uh, *am* I late?\n\n2. DEREK: Just on time. And it’s not *exactly* an appellate proceeding.\n\n**Panel Two**\nChelsea and Derek are filing through the door into a large, marble-tiled lobby.\n\n1. CHELSEA: I just wanted to thank you again. For taking me on, that is.\n\n2. DEREK: Thank *us?* With your credentials?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Chelsea.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Well, I mean, it’s not- It’s just-\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Derek.\n\n1. DEREK: Don’t be so modest, kid. Tell me, why’d you give up clerking?\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe two pass through another door, which swings out towards the reader so that the writing on the frosted glass is legible. It says “DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE.”\n\n1. CHELSEA: I think you know why.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – EIGHT PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot of the doorway from inside the office. The office well lit, but cluttered with cardboard boxes full of paperwork. Several desks are scattered around the room. Derek has turned to face Chelsea.\n\n1. DEREK: Your old man was a helluva lawyer. I always said they don’t make ‘em like Chuck McKay anymore, but I figure you’ve got plenty of time to prove an old fart like me wrong.\n\n2. VIC: (Off-panel) She just got here, Altman. Let her get a conviction or two before we crown the next Harvey Dent.\n\n**Panel Two**\nVIC CLARENCE, a scruffy-looking man in his mid-thirties, shakes Chelsea’s hand from his desk while Derek folds his arms in the background.\n\n1. CHELSEA: Chelsea McKay, I’m the new ADA.\n\n2. VIC: Vic Clarence. I’m an *old* ADA.\n\n3. DEREK: You know better than to joke about Harvey, Vic.\n\n**Panel Three**\nVic waves his hand at Derek.\n\n1. VIC: C’mon, Derek. Arkham screwballs are a fact of life for us.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Derek, grimacing.\n\n1. DEREK: Harvey’s *different*.\n\n**Panel Five**\nJANET CROFT, a middle-aged woman in a crisp suit, leans out from behind another desk.\n\n1. JANET: *Easy,* boys. New kid in town doesn’t need to see you two tearing each other’s throats out. Want me to get her set up with a caseload?\n\n**Panel Six**\nDerek straightens out his suit as Chelsea walks over to Janet.\n\n1. DEREK: Yes, of course. Thank you, Janet.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nJanet lays out a stack of papers on the desk in front of Chelsea.\n\n1. JANET: Welcome to the family, McKay. One good thing about working in Gotham is you never get bored.\n\n2. CHELSEA: I don’t suppose any of this relates to… the Penguin?\n\n3. JANET: Trust me, kid.\n\n**Panel Eight*\nCloseup of Janet.\n\n1. That’s one case you’d better hope you *never* get.\n\n**PAGE NINE – EIGHT PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh angle of a police car pulling up to the curb next to an old, worn-down brownstone. It’s darker than the last scene, but still day. Two more police cars are already parked.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHARVEY BULLOCK exits the cruiser holding a half-eaten doughnut. OFFICER 1, a uniformed officer, is stepping up to greet him.\n\n1. BULLOCK: OK, where’s the stiff?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: Uh, it’s upstai-\n\n3. BULLOCK: Just show me. And while we’re on the way, tell me why Major Crimes got this instead of Homicide, huh?\n\n**Panel Three**\nAngle from behind Bullock and Officer 1 as they’re walking down a hallway. There are doors, some of which have numbers and most of which have places where numbers used to be before they were worn off over time. The carpet has probably not been vacuumed in twenty years. OFFICER 2 is ducking into a door ahead.\n\n1. BULLOCK: That the place?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: That’s the bathroom, Detective Bullock.\n\n**Panel Four**\nAngle from ahead of Bullock and Officer 1 as they pass the bathroom door. Bullock’s doughnut is still in his hand, albeit a few bites smaller.\n\n1. OFFICER 2: (From inside the bathroom) *Urrrrf!*\n\n2. BULLOCK: Rookies.\n\n**Panel Five**\nOfficer 1 points into an open door.\n\n1. OFFICER 1: In here, sir.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup of Bullock in the doorway.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nThe same angle. Bullock is holding up his doughnut and looking at it suspiciously.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nBullock turns back to Officer 1.\n\n1. BULLOCK: I wasn’t gonna eat this anyway. You want it?\n\n**PAGE TEN – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBullock and Officer 1 are leaning on either side of the bathroom door. Inside, Officer 2 is washing his face.\n\n1. BULLOCK: So, this mess has been here, what? A day? Two days?\n\n2. OFFICER 1: Or longer.\n\n3. BULLOCK: Let me guess. The landlord only found it because the neighbors complained about the smell.\n\n4. OFFICER 1: Apparently, one of them threatened to call a lawyer.\n\n**Panel Two**\nOfficer 2 steps up to the doorway.\n\n1. BULLOCK: So our perp’s long gone, and I ain’t *certain*, but that didn’t look like enough chunks to make a whole human, so that ain’t even all of our *victim*.\n\n**Panel Three**\nOfficer 2 is now kneeling back by the toilet.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce is riding in the back of an expensive-looking black sedan. It’s night again outside. We see the edge of Alfred’s shoulder in the driver’s seat.\n\n1. BRUCE: Is everyone in position?\n\n2. ROBIN: (Via communicator) I’m set up with visual, but the most suspicious thing I’ve spotted is whatever they’ve got on the hors d’oeuvres tray.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Robin. An apprentice of sorts. The third to hold the title.\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) I’m inside their system. Their security is cutting edge… for about fifteen years ago.\n\n5. BATMAN: (Cap) Oracle. Formerly known as Batgirl. Now the superhero world’s foremost researcher and tech expert.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Bruce through the side window.\n\n1. BRUCE: Any data on our miracle drug?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Weirdly, no. Almost nothing. I’ve got some references to a “Project: Panacea” in budget documents but no testing records, no advertising material, and certainly no formula.\n\n3. BRUCE: Keep me posted. All right, I should be fashionably late enough by now. You can stop circling, Alfred.\n\n**Panel Three**\nWide shot of Bruce exiting the car onto a crowded sidewalk full of well-dressed people.\n\n1. VICKI: (Off-panel) Bruce!\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – FOUR PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce turns, facing VICKI VALE, who is running up to him waving a notepad.\n\n1. VICKI: I wasn’t expecting to see *you* here. Any insight on the mystery announcement?\n\n2. BRUCE: *I* wasn’t expecting to see me here either. I’m just a curious citizen tonight.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Vicki Vale. Reporter for the Gotham Gazette. We were close once. I made some sacrifices and more mistakes, but she eventually forgave me.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from in front of the two as they shuffle through the front door into a huge, ostentatious glass atrium.\n\n1. VICKI: You sure you’re not holding out on me?\n\n2. BRUCE: Promise. I’ll probably learn more from whatever *you* write than I will from the announcement.\n\n3. VICKI: Oh, I’ve heard *that* one before, Mr. Wayne.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot over Bruce’s shoulder as Vicki flits off into the crowd.\n\n1. GUS: (Off-panel) Ladies and gentlemen!\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle of GUS GORMAN, a man in his thirties who fills out a suit very nicely, standing at a lectern at the rear of the atrium. A well-dressed elderly couple are exiting an elevator, a janitor is entering another, a woman in a black dress is going into the stairwell, and a flustered-looking waitress is trying to slide across the edge of the stage to get back into the crowd. \n\n1. GORMAN: I’m so glad you all could make it, and I hope you like… *whatever* it is the hors d’oeuvres are.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Gus Gorman. Wall Street turnaround specialist. Brought on as CEO to salvage Gothcorp’s stock price after Ferris Boyle went to prison for insider trading.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nSame angle, but pull in a little closer on Gorman.\n\n1. GORMAN: It won’t do any of us any good to sugarcoat things. Gothcorp has made a lot of mistakes in the past. But I was hired to change all that. I was hired because I believe in change, progress, and new beginnings.\n\n**Panel Two**\nMove in for a closeup. Gorman is reaching into his jacket.\n\n1. GORMAN: Our incredible research team has been moving heaven and earth to *create* our new beginning. And the fruit of that effort…\n\n**Panel Three**\nExtreme closeup of Gorman’s hand holding a glass vial full of an almost-clear liquid with a very slight green tint.\n\n1. GORMAN: … Is *this*.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack out to the closeup. Gorman is holding the vial in front of his right eye.\n\n1. GORMAN: We call it “Panacea,” like the ancient Greek goddess of health—*universal* health, apparently. And you aren’t gonna believe this, but I’ll be darned if that isn’t what it does. Our testing so far indicates that Panacea can, with sufficient time and dosage, heal *any* injury.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe crowd erupts into raised hands and shouted questions. Bruce, in the foreground, is glancing suspiciously to the side.\n\n1. CROWD 1: How does it work?\n\n2. CROWD 2: Isn’t this too good to be true?\n\n3. CROWD 3: You don’t expect us to *believe* this?\n\n4. BRUCE: Something’s wrong about this.\n\n5. ORACLE: (Comm) *Everything’s* wrong about this.\n\n6. ROBIN: (Comm) But what if it really *does* do what he says?\n\n7. ORACLE: (Comm) It *doesn’t.*\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nA heavyset man in the crowd trips and falls.\n\n1. FALLING MAN: (SFX: Ghugh)\n\n2. CROWD 4: Oh my God!\n\n**Panel Two**\nBruce turns to look at the fallen man as a few more people begin to drop.\n\n1. BRUCE: Robin. Notice anything off about the waiters?\n\n2. ROBIN: (Comm) No, wh- Wait. There *are* none.\n\n3. BRUCE: Not *now*. So where…?\n\n**Panel Three**\nLow angle of a woman with long, dark hair in a waitstaff uniform approaching Gorman. She’s withdrawing a dagger from her sleeve.\n\n1. ROBIN: (Comm) There! Along the sides!\n\n**Panel Four**\nBruce tumbles over into a small round table covered with a tablecloth.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) This won’t be my cleanest change, but it’ll have to do.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWe see the tablecloth lying overtop of Bruce.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBatman rises from the floor towards the reader, throwing the cloth off.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe waitress assassin lunges at Gorman, knife in hand.\n\n1. GORMAN: Someone, help!\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup of a Batarang slicing through the assassin’s hand, making her drop the knife.\n\n1. SFX: SKKT!\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull out as Batman follows his weapon, sending the assassin sprawling with a punch to the face.\n\n1. GORMAN: You *did* come!\n\n**Panel Four**\nBatman grabs Gorman by the shoulder and begins to drag him away.\n\n1. BATMAN: There are more of them! *Move!*\n\n**Panel Five**\nAnother waitress, this one with shoulder-length blonde hair, is kneeling and firing a pistol.\n\n1. SFX: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman has his cape draped over Gorman and is pulling him into the stairwell. The gunshots are barely missing them.\n\n1. SFX: VTT! VTT! VTT!\n\n**Panel Two**\nA third waitress assassin, also blonde but with shorter hair, is kneeling next to the first one, who is still on all fours and bleeding from the nose. The second assassin is running up to them.\n\n1. ASSASSIN 3: You still kicking, Ches?\n\n2. ASSASSIN 1: I dink dat &@$#@!% broke by dose.\n\n3. ASSASSIN 2: What?\n\n3. ASSASSIN 1: Nebber bine, Buddy.\n\n**Panel Three**\nAngle from directly above Batman, still pulling Gorman up the stairs.\n\n1. BATMAN: Are there any other samples of Panacea in the building?\n\n2. GORMAN: The safe in my office – why?\n\n3. BATMAN: So I can protect you *and* them at the same time.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBatman is pushing a door open onto the next floor.\n\n1. BATMAN: Oracle. IDs on the assassins. Three women, two with knives, one with guns.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Asian and two blondes?\n\n3. BATMAN: Check.\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) Sounds like the Ravens. Leader is Cheshire. Bad news. Poison expert. Pistolera and Vicious are above-average in combat but not that bright. Names are pretty indicative.\n\n5. GORMAN: Who are you talking to? Where are we going? My office isn’t on this floor.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman is prying open the doors of the adjacent elevator.\n\n1. BATMAN: None of your concern, up, and we’re taking the elevator.\n\n2. GORMAN: Won’t those crazy people be inside?!\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot from inside the elevator shaft of Batman pulling out his grapnel gun.\n\n1. BATMAN: You ask too many questions.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from above Batman and Gorman. Batman is grappling up through the elevator shaft with Gorman in his free arm.\n\n1. GORMAN: *AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!*\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – TWO PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe Ravens are standing in the elevator, PISTOLERA on the left, VICIOUS on the right, and CHESHIRE in the middle. Vicious is tapping her fingers on the wall.\n\n1. SFX: T-t-t-t-tap!\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same shot. Pistolera looks at Vicious. Cheshire is grimacing.\n\n1. SFX: T-t-t-t-tap!\n\n2. PISTOLERA: You know, we *could’ve* taken the stai-\n\n3. VICIOUS: Shut up, Bunny.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – FOUR PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nThe Ravens burst out of the elevator into a carpeted hallway, brandishing their weapons.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Vicious.\n\n1. VICIOUS: Nobody here?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Pistolera.\n\n1. PISTOLERA: Maybe not here yet?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Cheshire.\n\n1. CHESHIRE: Mebbe ulreddy here. Buddy, jeck leff. Vish, wash de doors. I jeck right.\n\n2. PISTOLERA: (Off-panel) Got it. I… *think.*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SIX PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman is crouched behind a corner. Cheshire is approaching towards the reader on the right. Gorman is cowering behind Batman to the reader’s left. On the far right is a boardroom separated from the hallway by a glass wall.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Don’t know what weapons she has poisoned. Can’t risk much contact.\n\n**Panel Two**\nClose in and turn the angle a little to the right so we see more of the boardroom. Batman lunges forward and grabs Cheshire by the arm.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShift so we’re a full ninety degrees from Panel One’s angle, closing in over Batman’s shoulder. He’s throwing Cheshire through the glass wall into the boardroom.\n\n1. SFX: KRRRRSSSSH!\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Cheshire. She’s picked up a glass shard from the wall and is spitting on it.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Even her *spit’s* poisoned. This isn’t a fight I can afford to have with a civilian in tow.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman throws down a smoke pellet and begins to turn, pushing Gorman ahead of him down the hallway.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe smoke begins to fill the hall as the poisoned glass shard flies into the cloud.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Batman, I just noticed something.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – THREE PANELS**\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle of Batman pulling Gorman down a hallway.\n\n1. BATMAN: I’m a little busy right now, Oracle.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) This is important.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHigh angle of the same hallway, empty. The visual is grainy, as through the view of a low-quality camera.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) The security cameras aren’t showing you in the halls.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman and Gorman have reached a door with a plaque next to it saying “GUS GORMAN – CEO.” Batman is turning the doorknob.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) That means someone’s looping the footage, which means—\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – ONE PANEL**\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman has pushed open the office door, revealing a slick but unadorned office. Several cardboard boxes are still stacked in the corner. Standing in front of the safe in the back wall is none other than CATWOMAN.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) —Someone else is in the building.\n\n2. CATWOMAN: … Oops.\n\n3. CAPTION: To be continued!

The first three panels are that thing where there are unnecessary dividing lines in the middle of an otherwise continuous shot, which always annoys me, but I’m doing it anyway because I actually have a reason. There’s a slight filter on each panel.\n\n**Panels One to Three**\nWide shot. It’s night. The weather’s cleared up relative to last issue, though. We’re in what looks like a pretty nice part of town, too. The buildings are at least clean and in good condition. TIM DRAKE, dressed in a red jacket and black jeans, shuffles down the street alone from left to right, a yellow backpack slung over his back. There are three streetlights visible. One is out and the other two are flashing, indicating that they’re flickering. Panel One is red, Panel Two is green, and Panel Three is yellow.\n\n1. SFX: (By each light) Bzzt\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Tim. He’s looking up at one of the flickering lights quizzically. The one that was out before is visible behind him, now flashing again. The filter is orange here.\n\n1. SFX: Bzzt\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot between Tim’s feet as he walks along. We’re angled up enough to see that the flickering lights continue some distance down the street. There isn’t a filter so much as the palette is a little lighter and more washed out.\n\n1. SFX: Bzzt\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot over Tim’s shoulder. There’s a light right next to him that’s flickering, but the ones further down the street seem undamaged. Blue filter.\n\n1. SFX: Bzzt\n\n**Panel Seven**\nTim looks right. The flickering lights continue in that direction. Red filter.\n\n1. SFX: Bzzt\n\n**Panel Eight**\nCloseup. Tim stops again and gets his phone out, swiping at it. Yellow filter.\n\n**Panel Nine**\nExtreme closeup on the phone screen. He’s marking the locations where the lights are flickering on a map of Gotham. We see that we’re on the southern island, Old Gotham. The phone’s white glow substitutes for a filter.\n\n**PAGE TWO – NINE PANELS**\nThree-by-three grid. The filters are still there.\n\n**Panels One, Two, Four, and Five**\nThese form the top-left square. Shot from above of Tim walking, staring intently at his phone. We can’t see quite what he’s doing. Panel One has a blue filter, Panels Two and Four are both orange, and Panel Five is green.\n\n1. SFX: Bzzt\n\n**Panels Three and Six**\nShot from in front of Tim. He’s looking up from the phone and has broken into a jog. Panel Three has a red filter and Panel Six has a yellow one.\n\n1. SFX: Bzzt\n\n**Panel Seven**\nTim is looking down at his phone in surprise. Green filter.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nExtreme closeup on the phone screen. The map Tim is drawing has formed the distinct shape of a dotless QUESTION MARK. The phone’s glow is working in place of a filter again.\n\n**Panel Nine**\nTim’s POV. We’re looking up at WAYNE TOWER, where the “W” in “Wayne” is out. Tim is lowering the phone, but we can see him circling the location, giving the question mark its dot. Blue filter.\n\n1. TIM: (Off-panel) (Whispering) Oh, not *again.*\n\n**PAGE THREE – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of one and two rows of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nTim is in front of the door of an old brick building. He’s ringing the doorbell, which looks like one of those video doorbell thingies, but a little makeshift. The camera looks like a somewhat expensive but unremarkable consumer video camera, and the button is a standard doorbell.\n\n1. TIM: Hey, are you awake in there?\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Elec) The doorbell? On the *front door?* I’m impressed; who taught you that one?\n\n3. TIM: Wonder Girl gave me some pointers. Now, would you let me in?

A door to his left is ~~not a door~~ ajar.\n\n**Panel Four**\nTim peeks through the door into a room which, based on the layout, probably *used* to be an apartment, but it’s empty other than a *very* large, half-assembled computer. A few wires leading into the wall are connected to it.\n\n1. TIM: (Whispering) A Kordtronics Cocoon-11?\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Elec) I got a discount. Now are you going to come *up* here, or just ogle my hardware all night?\n\n3. TIM: Sorry!\n\n**Panel Five**\nTim jogs through a set of elevator doors at the end of the hall.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nTim exits into- Well, look. It’s *me* writing this. Where do you *think* we are? If you must know, we’re in the CLOCKTOWER, specifically BARBARA GORDON’s apartment. She’s approaching as he exits.\n\n1. BABS: I *knew* there was a reason I liked you. Dinah or Dick would be snickering about that phrasing for the next week.\n\n2. TIM: Huh? What phrasing?\n\n3. BABS: … Skip it. What’ve you got?\n\n**Panel Two**\nTim drops his backpack on the kitchen table and begins digging through it while handing his phone to Babs.\n\n1. TIM: The lights were flickering on these streets. Notice anything familiar?\n\n2. BABS: *Just* what we needed right now. Any pattern to the flickering?\n\n**Panel Three**\nTim has retrieved a sheet of paper and turns to hand it to her.\n\n1. TIM: I tried Morse Code, but it came out gibberish.\n\n2. BABS: Maybe more than one layer to this. A cipher? Definitely not Atbash or ROT13, and… yeah, not *any* Caesar Cipher.\n\n3. TIM: How do you *know?*\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Babs, smirking.\n\n1. BABS: I just tried them all.\n\n2. TIM: (Off-panel) Showoff.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot between the two looking down at the text and the map.\n\n1. BABS: So the *bad* news is that this could take *hours* to decrypt, depending on what kind of cipher it is. The good news is that Nygma is a real wise@$$ and probably also left a clue to the key, which cuts that down to seconds.\n\n2. TIM: The dot. Wayne Tower.\n\n3.

BABS: I’ll see if some permutation of that works. Call Bruce while I crack this, would you?\n\n2. TIM: Got it.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Babs’ computer screen. She has a program called “CRYPTOGRAPHIC SEQUENCER” open.\n* CIPHERTEXT: `SHCEIWRCGLARCZEJYEEIWTTBPQMCFMJTMGEHSGYIJCC`\n* KEY: `WAYNEWAYNEWAYNEWAYNEWAYNEWAYNEWAYNEWAYNEWAY`\n* CIPHER TYPE: VIGENÈRE\n* PLAINTEXT: `WHEREARETHEREMANYGREATVOLUMESINTOTALSILENCE`\n\n1. BABS: (Off-panel) Well, that was easy. Weird *phrasing,* too.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBabs is in the foreground, squinting at her screen. Tim is in the background, holding his Bat-Communicator. He’s looking back at Babs curiously.\n\n1. TIM: “Great volumes” – maybe like books?\n\n2. BABS: Oh, yeah, the answer is *definitely* a library. But what *about* a library? Are we supposed to *go* to one? Which?\n\n3. BATMAN: (From the communicator) I’m en route.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on BATMAN, driving the BATMOBILE.\n\n1. BATMAN: Incidentally, Bruce Wayne’s great granduncle, Ferdinand Wayne, was deaf from birth.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) That’s it!\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack to Oracle. She’s turning back to her computer and Tim is looking over her shoulder.\n\n1. ORACLE: The Ferdinand Wayne Memorial Library was condemned last year but never demolished. Classic bad guy hideout material.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Comm) I’ll go directly there.\n\n3. TIM: I have my suit. I’ll meet you.\n\n**PAGE SIX – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of one, a row of three, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe Batmobile is parked in front of a building which… probably *was* impressive at the time it was constructed. More than a hundred years ago. At this point, it’s just a fairly run-down brick façade. Batman is exiting the Batmobile as Robin swings in from above.\n\n1. ROBIN: What’s our plan of attack?\n\n**Panel Two**\nTwo-shot of the Dynamic Duo.\n\n1. BATMAN: If he *is* using this location, Nygma will have all of the entrances covered.\n\n2. ROBIN: Front door’s as good as anything, then, right?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Robin, looking amused.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Off-panel) … We’ll use one of the second-story windows. Just in case.\n\n**Panel Four**\nOracle, facepalming.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman and Robin are climbing a rope up to a window. If the framing were to remind the reader of Adam West and Burt Ward, that would not be entirely unintentional. Batman is reaching towards the window.\n\n1. ROBIN: Hold it. You see what I see?\n\n2. BATMAN: The motion sensor. Good catch. Note that they’re in *all* the windows.\n\n3. ROBIN: We could try to fool it.\n\n4. BATMAN: We’d need specialized gear. Let’s test what it does first.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from inside. We’re on a balcony level of a library. Batman is entering through a window. There’s no apparent response triggered by the sensor.\n\n1. ROBIN: All clear?\n\n2. BATMAN: Clear enough.\n\n**Panel Two**\nRobin has followed Batman through and they’re exploring in opposite directions.\n\n1. ROBIN: Well, *this* is underwhelming.\n\n2. BATMAN: Tempting fate.\n\n3. ROBIN: True. Should we check downstairs?\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman and Robin are landing in the middle of the library. In the foreground is a table with a flat green pad on it.\n\n1. ROBIN: How much do you want to bet *that’s* what we’re looking for?\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Elec) Ah ah ah, Boy Wonder. Don’t you know that gambling is a con?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Batman and Robin, looking for the source of the voice.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) Edward Nygma. The Riddler. Compelled to leave puzzles as a clue to his crimes. *Highly* inflated opinion of his own intelligence.\n\n2. RIDDLER: (Elec) *Not* a thinking man’s game. And *you two* will have to think *fast* if you want to stop this building’s scheduled demolition by Bletchley Construction in the next, oh, fourteen minutes and twenty-nine seconds.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot over Batman’s shoulder towards the entrance.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) *Plenty* of time to leave, of course. But I’d hate to be one of the tenants in the apartment building next door right about now. Or, ah, right about fourteen minutes and twelve seconds from now, anyway.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nRobin is kneeling, pulling a cardboard box full of puzzle pieces out from under the table with the green pad.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) Maybe you’d better switch the bomb off by solving this puzzle first. And by “first,” I *of course* mean in the next thirteen minutes and fifty-two seconds.\n\n**Panel Two**\nRobin is beginning to remove pieces from the box.\n\n1. ROBIN: No *way* we can finish this in time.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Batman, looking around the room.\n\n1. BATMAN: With the Riddler, there’s always a trick.\n\n**Panel Four**\nRobin removes his cape.\n\n1. ROBIN: Or maybe we can make our *own* trick.\n\n**PAGE NINE – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nRobin lays his cape out across the green pad.\n\n1. ROBIN: We can fool this thing with our own gear.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) He’s right. Sewn into the lining of our capes are small tubes which can be pumped full of pressurized fluid to form rigid wings for gliding.\n\n**Panel Two**\nRobin removes a small tank-like gadget from his back.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) That fluid, spread across the surface of the cape…\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from above. As described, a clear liquid sprays out of the tank, spreading across the cape.\n\n1. BATMAN: (Cap) … Should apply even pressure across the pad…\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from the side. The pad is depressing slightly.\n\n1. SFX: KLICK\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) … Substituting for the puzzle itself.\n\n3. BATMAN: Good thinking, Robin.\n\n4. ROBIN: I do my best. Could use a new cape, though.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman and Robin are looking up again.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) You know, I tested that trap myself. I completed the challenge with a little under ninety seconds to spare. But can you even be *bothered* to *try? **Noooooooo…***\n\n**PAGE TEN – FOUR PANELS**\nStack.\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman is pointing to Robin.\n\n1. BATMAN: This library is covered in dust. Grab anything that looks tampered with and load it into the Batmobile. We’ll reconstruct everything at the Clocktower.\n\n2. ROBIN: Got it.\n\n3. RIDDLER: (Elec) (Behind the other two speech bubbles) For *years* I’ve sought only a fair contest of intellect, and I am continually thwarted by your *puerile* attempts at circumventing the *entirely reasonable* parameters of-\n\n**Panel Two**\nRobin is running off as Batman turns to face the reader, tapping his cowl radio.\n\n1. BATMAN: The bomb appears to be inactive, but GCPD should be notified.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Way ahead of you.\n\n3. RIDDLER: (Elec) (Behind) -forever *surrounded* by *muscle-headed thugs* who compensate for their sad, forsaken little minds with *crass brutishness,* and *then* have the *gall* to call me a-\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman is at least *exiting* through the front door, Robin following with a bunch of books and newspapers in his arms.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) (From inside) Batman?! Where are you going?! Come back here and account for yourself! You’ll *never* solve the next clue! Not if you’re resorting to trickery already! ***Nev-***\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on the door being slammed shut by Batman’s gloved hand.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nBack in the clocktower. The puzzle is laid out on the kitchen table, partially completed. Batman and Robin are looking over Oracle’s shoulders. There’s a pile of papers and books on the corner of the table.\n\n1. ROBIN: A movie poster? “Burning Bridges.” Why does that sound familiar?\n\n2. ORACLE: The pyrotechnics consultant was Garfield Lynns, his last movie before he became Firefly.\n\n3. ROBIN: How-\n\n4. ORACLE: Memorized his filmography.\n\n5. ROBIN: Of course you did.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBatman is rifling through the pile.\n\n1. BATMAN: The newspapers we recovered were from six years ago. I recall that Lynns tried to kill the producer of Burning Bridges around then.\n\n2. ROBIN: You think he’s *involved* in this?\n\n3. BATMAN: Maybe.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman holds up a newspaper.\n\n1. BATMAN: This paper is from that day.\n\n2. ORACLE: So what do we *do* with it?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Robin, rubbing his chin.\n\n1. ROBIN: Firefly, huh?\n\n2. ROBIN: Try a match. Could be invisible ink.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Batman. He’s struck a match and is holding it up next to his face. The background is otherwise dar- *Hey,* this sounds familiar.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Off-panel) Since when do you carry matches?\n\n2. BATMAN: I keep them with my sunglasses and fake mustache.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBatman holds the match up next to the newspaper, and we see there is indeed invisible ink fading in. It reads “DC140.”\n\n1. ROBIN: (Off-panel) What does that mean?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Off-panel) Initials and page number?\n\n3. BATMAN: (Off-panel) License plate?\n\n4. ROBIN: (Off-panel) Another code?\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – FIVE PANELS**\nStack.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide shot of the table. The three heroes are huddled over a slightly more disheveled pile of books as they solve more puzzles. We see the Clocktower’s clock face in the background. It’s readable; about 2 AM.\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same angle. Robin is pointing at something and Batman is nodding while Oracle runs a hand through her hair and stares into an empty cup of coffee, possibly attempting to will it into being full again. The clock says 4 AM.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe same angle. Robin has his head laid on his arms, clearly sleeping. Oracle is gesturing at Batman with her coffee cup. It’s 6 AM and it’s sunrise outside. I’d say we can *see* the sun, but I already indicated that the clock faces westward in Oracle #2, and that would create an irreconcilable continuity error and destroy my credibility with the readers.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle. Robin is awake again. He’s scratching his head while Oracle is hunched over a book with a pencil. Batman is standing outside the clockface, staring into the distance. 8 AM.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle. The three are once again huddled around the table, now joined by a fourth investigator. SPOILER is in the foreground, pointing at something we can’t see. 10 AM.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of one and two rows of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Spoiler.\n\n1. SPOILER: See these capitalized letters? They spell “Dark.” I bet that, or some synonym, is the cipher key we were looking for.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Cap) Spoiler. Stephanie Brown. Father was the Cluemaster, villain with similar M.O. to Riddler. Nowhere close to ready for field work. But as a detective? Shows definite potential.\n\n3. BATMAN: (Cap) Bringing her in was Robin’s idea. Admittedly, we’ve made almost as much progress in the last hour as we did in the preceding seven.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Oracle. The others are looking at her in the background.\n\n1. ORACLE: Well, that gives me something.\n\n2. ROBIN: What’ve you got?\n\n3. ORACLE: “What will you find on the hill?”\n\n**Panel Three**\nSpoiler grabs her head.\n\n1. SPOILER: #&@%! Another riddle!\n\n2. ROBIN: That’s Nygma for you.\n\n3. SPOILER: I just can’t believe that *two* people have time for this crap.\n\n**Panel Four**\nRobin picks up one of the books.\n\n1. ROBIN: OK, OK, did we see anything about a hill?\n\n2. SPOILER: (Off-panel) Wait, wait, that’s not quite it.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBack to Spoiler.\n\n1. SPOILER: Think: Why “Dark?” *That’s* got to be the hint.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Off-panel) Of course!\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nOracle is holding up a copy of *The Hobbit*.\n\n1. ORACLE: This was one of the books he moved, right? Riddles in the Dark – the Gollum chapter.\n\n**Panel Two**\nRobin and Spoiler crowd around the book.\n\n1. ROBIN: So on the hill – it’s horses. “Thirty white horses on a red hill. First they champ, then they stamp, then they stand still.”\n\n2. BATMAN: (Off-panel) Teeth.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Batman.\n\n1. BATMAN: Nygma once built a hideout in an abandoned dentist’s office. He’d stolen an antique set of jeweled braces.\n\n2. ROBIN: (Off-panel) Of *course* he had.\n\n**Panel Four**\nSpoiler stands up.\n\n1. SPOILER: So that’s where we’re going?\n\n2. BATMAN: “We’re” not g-\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Oracle, glaring. Batman is reflected in her glasses.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBack to Batman.\n\n1. BATMAN: … Yes. It is.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nStack.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle of the Batmobile driving away from the Clocktower.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from above as the Batmobile pulls up next to a one-story brick building.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman, Robin, and Spoiler are getting out of the Batmobile.\n\n1. ROBIN: *Now* can we use the front door?\n\n2. BATMAN: There may be a way in on the roof.\n\n3. SPOILER: Vents, maybe?\n\n4. ROBIN: (SFX: Sigh)\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe three are on the roof. Batman is indeed already climbing into a ventilation unit.\n\n1. SPOILER: Would be tough to place *too* many death traps in the vents.\n\n2. ROBIN: You’re not helping, Spoiler.\n\n**Panel Five**\nRobin is climbing in after Batman. Spoiler is shrugging and waving her hands confusedly.\n\n1. SPOILER: What? What’d I do?\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of three and two rows of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman is landing from a drop ceiling in the middle of an empty examination room. Robin is looking out from above.\n\n1. BATMAN: Quiet again.\n\n2. ROBIN: Knowing Nygma, not for long.\n\n**Panel Two**\nRobin and Spoiler have now dropped down. The three heroes are looking around the room.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) Ah, finally. I was beginning to worry I wouldn’t even have *time* to present you with this penultimate puzzle. I’ll have to be brief as it is.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Spoiler, shrugging.\n\n1. SPOILER: Gee. Our loss.\n\n2. RIDDLER: (Elec) Be quiet! *This* time, you have only *ten* minutes, so do endeavor to listen *carefully.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on a gas nozzle in the wall.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) When your time runs out, this building will fill with poison gas.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on the front door, over which a metal shutter with a green question mark spray painted on it has fallen.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) All points of *exit* open in *twenty* minutes.\n\n**Panel Six**\nOver to another nozzle.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) The gas can be neutralized with a certain solvent.\n\n2. RIDDLER: (Elec) The nozzle will only respond to the pressure of *exactly* four liters of solvent.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nFinally, on a set of three jugs of identical shape and size.\n\n1. RIDDLER: (Elec) One of the jugs on the front desk contains exactly *eight* liters.\n\n2. RIDDLER: (Elec) Have fun chasing your tails, children.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nBatman, Robin, and Spoiler have moved over to the jugs.\n\n1. SPOILER: I know this puzzle. Like in that one Die Hard movie.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Robin, picking up one of the jugs.\n\n1. ROBIN: It’s a classic logic game. Only, the jugs are supposed to be *different* sizes. I don’t know how you’d solve it if they’re *all* eight liters.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman picks up another.\n\n1. BATMAN: Maybe they *aren’t.* They’re opaque; the cavities inside could be different sizes.\n\n2. ROBIN: So how do we know which is which?\n\n**Panel Four**\nSpoiler grabs the last jug.\n\n1. SPOILER: Would this place still have running water?\n\n**Panel Five**\nBatman is taking off down the hall.\n\n1. BATMAN: It shouldn’t. Shouldn’t have running *poison gas* either.\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe three are now in the bathroom, kneeling next to the three jugs, which are laid out on the floor.\n\n1. ROBIN: … Which makes *this* the three-liter. Not sure I remember how to do this, though.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Oracle, back at the Clocktower.\n\n1. ORACLE: Fear not, Boy Wonder. Google is a wonderful thing.\n\n**Panel Three**\nRobin is pouring one of the jugs into another.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Start by filling up the five-liter jug…\n\n**Panel Four**\nBatman is attaching one of the jugs to the nozzle.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Is it working?\n\n2. BATMAN: *Assuming* Riddler didn’t lie about the *rules,* yes.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWide shot of the three standing in the middle of the empty examination room, looking around.\n\n1. SPOILER: So, do we wait out the doors?\n\n2. BATMAN: No. But wait for the gas.\n\n3. ROBIN: Why?\n\n**Panel Six**\nPull in closer. Clear mist is beginning to waft into the room as the three begin to put on breath masks.\n\n1. BATMAN: I have a suspicion about our next clue.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of one, a row of three, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nAs the gas spreads, a string of writing appears on the wall.\n\n1. WRITING: `WACLAERPGZASUMYNUEJEFXLIIDYVFZGBMTBHRYSBFCZ`\n\n2. ROBIN: *Another* cipher?\n\n3. BATMAN: No. We’re chasing our own tails, remember? It’s another key to the *first* cipher. It’s the same number of characters.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Oracle.\n\n1. ORACLE: That gives me… “What is an amazing weaver with no hands and a big head?”\n\n**Panel Three**\nBatman, scratching his chin.\n\n1. BATMAN: A… spider?\n\n**Panel Four**\nRobin and Spoiler are looking at each other.\n\n1. SPOILER: No, not *just* a spider.\n\n2. ROBIN: More of a…\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot of a recent *Gazette* issue, open to an article entitled “RARE COMIC COLLECTION INCLUDING MINT AMAZING FANTASY #15 TO SELL FOR MORE THAN $30 MILLION.”\n\n1. ROBIN: (Cap) “… friendly neighborhood Spider-*Man.*”\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – FOUR PANELS**\nStack.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot of a green van with a question mark painted on it, parked in a wealthy-looking suburban neighborhood.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (From inside the van) Kinda funny ta think of all that money goin’ for a bunch of funnybooks, eh, boss?\n\n**Panel Two**\nInside the van, several men are gathered around a blueprint of a large house. Most of them are dressed in fairly plain clothes other than that they’re all wearing green shirts, jackets, or hats. In the middle of the group is THE RIDDLER, wearing his trademark suit and gesticulating with his cane.\n\n1. RIDDLER: Which is why the *thinking* remains *my* responsibility in our little enterprise.\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull in closer on the Riddler, fiddling with the cane.\n\n1. RIDDLER: Rest assured that our prize will prove *quite* lucrative, gentlemen.\n\n**Panel Four**\nA little tighter. We’re looking at one of the Riddler’s eyes through the crook of the cane.\n\n1. RIDDLER: And with the *so-called* World’s Greatest Detective’s frankly *embarrassing* performance at solving the little gauntlet I left for him, we have *plenty* of time to claim it.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – SPLASH**\nWe shift our attention down to the table. Lying on one corner is a piece of paper with writing in fancy script.\n\n1. PAPER: Koning Industries cordially invites you, Edward Nygma, to an auction for the sale of the BATMAN’s true identity.\n\n2. RIDDLER: (Off-panel) And from there, it’s on to even *greater* things.\n\n3. TITLE: BATMAN: OMEGA! PART I\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – SPLASH**\nA well-dressed, blond-haired teenager is getting punched in the face. He’s sprawling.\n\n1. TITLE: BRUCE WAYNE, CHAPTER I – SHADOW OF THE CAT, PART II – MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SKIN A CAT\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-THREE – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe blond teenager is on the ground, rubbing his jaw.\n\n1. BLOND TEENAGER: All right, that *wasn’t* bad.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBRUCE, dressed in more casual clothes, helps the blond teenager to his feet. We see that they’re in a small park in the city.\n\n1. BLOND TEENAGER: *Where* did you say you learned that, Bruce?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Bruce.\n\n1. BRUCE: Mister Grant’s gym. You know he was the champ a long time ago?\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack to the blond teenager, one eyebrow raised.\n\n1. BLOND TEENAGER: I’m not *exactly* an avid student of boxing history.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBruce is walking away.\n\n1. BRUCE: Ah, you’re not an avid student of *anything,* Tommy.\n\n2. TOMMY: *Excuse* me?\n\n3. BRUCE: (Cap) Entry 1. I feel I should document my progress. Both towards my goal, and towards determining what my goal should *be.* To that end, I’ve begun this journal.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-FOUR – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce and Tommy begin to walk down the street.\n\n1. TOMMY: Wait! I’ll come with you.\n\n2. BRUCE: I don’t know, Tom. Mister Grant might not like you.\n\n3. TOMMY: What *exactly* is *that* supposed to mean?\n\n4. BRUCE: (Cap) This is Thomas Elliot. A friend. I *think.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nBruce turns around, walking backwards while he talks to Tommy.\n\n1. BRUCE: Well, I don’t know. I just couldn’t see myself walking into the gym in a suit.\n\n2. TOMMY: If he doesn’t like me, let *him* tell me that.\n\n3. BRUCE: Suit yourself.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBruce is now facing forward as Tommy still trails behind him. Tommy has a sly smirk while Bruce is rolling his eyes.\n\n1. TOMMY: I thought suiting myself was the *problem.*\n\n2. BRUCE: *Very* funny.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle. Bruce looks surprised.\n\n1. TOMMY: Something amiss, chum?\n\n2. BRUCE: That building just ahead. It’s the gym.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-FIVE – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of one and two rows of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide shot of Ted Grant’s gym, surrounded by police cars. Police tape is strung across the entrance.\n\n1. TOMMY: Well, that *would* be a problem, wouldn’t it?\n\n**Panel Two**\nBruce runs up to a police officer.\n\n1. BRUCE: What happened here?\n\n2. OFFICER: Guy who owns this place got dragged off in the middle of the night. You *know* something, kid?\n\n3. BRUCE: Well, not-\n\n**Panel Three**\nTwo-shot. Tommy has a hand on Bruce’s shoulder.\n\n1. TOMMY: We’re *friends* of Mister Grant. Maybe we could be of assistance if we knew more?\n\n**Panel Four**\nTommy has stepped in front of Bruce to talk to the officer. Bruce looks at him like he just grew a second head.\n\n1. OFFICER: What’s to know? The place is smashed and the owner’s gone. If you know about any enemies he had, we could collect a statement-\n\n2. TOMMY: No, I can’t imagine who’d do a terrible thing like this. Thank you, Officer.\n\n**Panel Five**\nTommy and Bruce walk away from the scene. Tommy is taking a long step while Bruce jogs to keep up with him.\n\n1. BRUCE: What the hell was *that?*\n\n2. TOMMY: Well, you *did* want to find out what they knew, didn’t you? I got bored of watching you embarrass yourself, so I made it easier.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBruce gestures back at the gym.\n\n1. BRUCE: OK, fine. But how do you propose we get back in there?\n\n2. TOMMY: Get back in…?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nCloseup on Bruce.\n\n1. BRUCE: We’ve started this. We’ve got to finish it! Figure out what happened.\n\n2. TOMMY: By sneaking into a crime scene?!\n\n3. BRUCE: Yes. And you’re coming with me, too.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-SIX – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nFrom Bruce’s POV. Tommy is backing away.\n\n1. TOMMY: Absolutely not. If- if I get in trouble, and my mother- She- If-\n\n2. BRUCE: Tom.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBruce plants a hand on Tommy’s shoulder.\n\n1. BRUCE: We *won’t* get caught.\n\n2. TOMMY: Easy enough to *say.*\n\n3. BRUCE: I’ve already got a plan.\n\n4. TOMMY: Now I’m even *more* frightened.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBruce is gesturing back towards the gym.\n\n1. BRUCE: So, we obviously can’t go in through the front door…\n\n2. TOMMY: … *Obviously.*\n\n3. BRUCE: But if we could get up onto those rooftops next door, we could drop down and get in from above.\n\n4. TOMMY: That’s a two-story drop from either side!\n\n**Panel Four**\nOn Bruce, shrugging.\n\n1. BRUCE: It’ll be a challenge. If you’re *up* to it.\n\n**Panel Five**\nOn Tommy, scowling.\n\n1. TOMMY: Fine. I’ll do it. But someday, Wayne, when you least expect it, I *will* have my revenge.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-SEVEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce and Tommy are climbing a fire escape.\n\n1. TOMMY: It will be slow, but *brutal.*\n\n2. BRUCE: Like when you presented your science project in Seventh Grade?\n\n**Panel Two**\nThey emerge onto the roof of an adjacent building.\n\n1. TOMMY: Years from now, your entire life will begin to collapse around you, and you won’t know why.\n\n2. BRUCE: Keep it down. Those cops might hear us.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe two come to the edge and look down on the gym’s roof.\n\n1. TOMMY: (Whispering) It’ll be *me,* Bruce. *I’ll* be the mastermind.\n\n2. BRUCE: (Whispering) OK, mastermind, how do we get down this building?\n\n3. TOMMY: (Whispering) It’s *your* ridiculous plan, Wayne! *You* figure something out.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Bruce, looking thoughtful.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-EIGHT – SIX PANELS**\nThree-by-two grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nBruce and Tommy are climbing down the wall with a rope.\n\n1. TOMMY: (Whispering) I’ll kill you at the end of the whole thing, too. Did I mention that part?\n\n2. BRUCE: Sh!\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe two enter through the roof door.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThey exit from the stairwell.\n\n1. TOMMY: *Now* what?\n\n2. BRUCE: Split up and look for clues?\n\n3. TOMMY: Genius. Why didn’t *I* think of it?\n\n**Panel Four**\nTommy strolls towards a punching bag in the foreground while Bruce ducks into a door in the background.\n\n1. BRUCE: I’m going to check the office. You look around out here.\n\n**Panel Five**\nTommy takes a half-hearted swing at the punching bag.\n\n1. BRUCE: (From the office) What a mess.\n\n**Panel Six**\nTommy is shaking his hand in pain.\n\n1. TOMMY: (Whispering) Ow.\n\n2. BRUCE: (From the office) Hey, I’ve got something!\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-NINE – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nTommy follows Bruce into the office. The whole place has been turned upside-down. Paperwork is spilled across the floor, a lamp is overturned, the computer has been smashed, and a trophy case is broken open, a gold belt thrown haphazardly onto the opposite wall. Bruce is not visible.\n\n1. TOMMY: Well, after all this trouble, I hope they *found* something.\n\n2. BRUCE: (Off-panel) Check the underside of the desk.\n\n**Panel Two**\nTommy kneels down, rolling his eyes.\n\n**Panel Three**\nLooking at the underside. “GL - HELL FERN” is scratched into it.\n\n1. BRUCE: I’m guessing he *wasn’t* attacked by a demonic house plant, so what does it mean?\n\n**Panel Four**\nTwo-shot of both boys crouching under the desk.\n\n1. TOMMY: What, you haven’t heard of Karl Hellfern?\n\n2. BRUCE: I… don’t think so?\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Tommy.\n\n1. TOMMY: Odd. I’d think you’d know the man who took your father’s job.\n\n2.

We can see the gaudy lights of the casinos along the Boardwalk to the left and down the Spine, which proceeds inland at ninety degrees from the Boardwalk. The industrial grit of Melville and the urban decay of the Zee Moors are visible on the far side of the Spine, while the humbly dignified antiquity of Baily Church’s outdated architecture sprawls closer to the reader. In the foreground, NIGHTWING is diving head-first from the roof of Baily Church’s eponymous cathedral, illuminated by multicolored light from the large stained glass window in the church’s façade, which faces the ocean.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Caption) My city.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Funny, never thought *I’d* be using that line.\n\n**PAGE TWO – FIVE PANELS**\nA large panel taking up most of the page, a small insert, and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle from the south as Nightwing catches himself with a grapnel line and swings forward, a wide grin on his face.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) That’s usually more Batman’s thing.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Oh, I used to work for him, by the way. You probably knew me as Robin back then.\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup of Nightwing’s foot touching down on a roof.\n\n**Panel Three**\nHigh angle from behind Nightwing as he crouches on the corner of a low rooftop.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I struck out on my own, found a new family, lost it, found it again, lost it *again*, and then I fell in love.\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle again. Nightwing is leaping off the roof, grapnel gun once again in hand.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Not with a woman—not that I *haven’t* done *that* two or three times—with a *city*. My city. *This* city.\n\n**Panel Five**\nNightwing zips along the street with his grapnel line. The buildings are blurred from the speed.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Blüdhaven. Ugly name for an ugly town. But it needs a hero and I’m here for it.\n\n**PAGE THREE – FIVE PANELS**\nPanel One is set into the top left corner of Panel Two. Then a row of two and a wide panel.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup of DICK GRAYSON, in his police uniform, holding out a pair of handcuffs.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I consider it a full-time job.\n\n2. CAPTION: Earlier today.\n\n3. DICK: You have the right to remain silent…\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe pull out to see an empty, graffiti-covered parking garage. Afternoon light streams in from outside. Dick and the man he’s arresting are next to a beat-up red sedan, its trunk open and full of guns. A second car, this one black but in similar condition, is parked to the right. A second criminal is sprawled on the ground near the red car, unconscious. A third is leaning against the black car, nursing a broken jaw. A fourth is being shoved by a scowling AMY ROHRBACH, also in uniform.\n\n1. AMY: *Please* exercise it.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) That’s my partner, Amy Rohrbach. One of the *other* five or so honest cops in BPD. She’s always been… *intense*, but she’s been particularly on edge since I got back from my last leave.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Dick cuffing his perp.\n\n1. DICK: *Easy*, Sarge. These guys are more than done.\n\n**Panel Four**\nMirrored closeup on Amy doing the same.\n\n1. AMY: Don’t- (SFX: Huff) You’re right. Let’s just bring them in.\n\n**Panel Five**\nTwo-shot. Amy is sitting at a desk, frowning at a stack of paperwork. Dick is leaning against the wall to the right, feet crossed. They’re both holding Styrofoam cups with steam drifting out of them. Next to Dick is a window. Outside, we can see that the sun is getting low in the sky, but not set.\n\n1. DICK: You doing all right, Amy?\n\n2. AMY: Fine.\n\n3. DICK: Well, if you don’t need anything else, I’ve got sort of an appointment.\n\n4. AMY: I drew short straw on paperwork anyway.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle from behind Dick. He’s approaching his apartment building, a humble three-story brick building on a street of similar structures. Closer to the door is the hulking figure of AARON HELZINGER, dressed in his prison guard’s uniform.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) That’s my building, by the way.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Not a turn of phrase, either. I had to buy it to save it from demolition. *Long* story.\n\n**Panel Two**\nPull up and in a little as Dick passes Aaron and the two wave to each other.\n\n1. AARON: Hello, Mister Grayson.\n\n2. DICK: Aaron.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Aaron Helzinger used to be called Amygdala. Weird being neighbors with a supervillain, but he’s a sweet guy when he’s on his meds. Works up at the penitentiary these days.\n\n**Panel Three**\nInside, Dick begins to ascend the stairs. DAVE TOUSSANT leans out from a ground-floor door to wave.\n\n1. DAVE: ‘Evening, Dick.\n\n2. DICK: Hey, Dave. How’s the little one?\n\n3. DAVE: Just fine, thanks for asking.\n\n4. NIGHTWING: (Cap) That’s Dave Toussant, the new super. My… *other half* helped him and his daughter Kesia out of a jam a while back.\n\n**Panel Four**\nAt the top of the stairs, Dick bumps into JOHN LAW.\n\n1. DICK: Sorry, Mister Law. Wasn’t looking where I was going.\n\n2. JOHN: I think I can still take a couple bumps, son.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) And the tour ends with Jonathan Law, formerly known as the Tarantula. Novelist turned superhero turned novelist again.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWe finally follow Dick into his own apartment, clearly cheap, but neat and well-maintained. He’s taking off his hat and jacket. The sun still hasn’t quite set, but it’s close.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) There’s still time before dark.\n\n**Panel Six**\nWe finally move back around to his front as Nightwing swings away from the window.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) But hey, I never minded a little sunlight.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – SIX PANELS**\nEstablishing shot, a row of two, and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh angle from behind Nightwing, crouching on a rooftop. It’s night, and the moon is beginning to rise. Below is a warehouse. On the far side of the warehouse are the docks. It’s austere, but not abandoned. Two men in dark clothing, CRIMINAL 1 and CRIMINAL 2, are moving a large crate to a truck parked on the street. A third, CRIMINAL 3, is holding the door open.\n\n1. CAPTION: Now.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) An informant heard about this job through the grapevine.\n\n**Panel Two**\nNightwing is now kneeling on the street side of the truck. We can see Criminal 1 and Criminal 2 with the crate approaching from behind.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) But it’s like a game of Telephone – the more people the info passed through to reach me, the more garbled it is. I need to take a closer look before I make any moves.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup of Criminal 1 peering around the corner of the truck.\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle, pulled out a little. Nightwing is hiding on the roof.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Who *are* these guys, anyway? Too white to be Madame Minh’s, and the *big guy* would send some costumed muscle for a job this size.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from the roof of the warehouse. Nightwing is pulling himself up.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I mean, he could at *least* spare Brutale or Electrocutioner.\n\n**Panel Six**\nNightwing is looking through the skylight. It’s dark inside, but we can see rows of shelves with similar crates on them. CRIMINAL 4 and CRIMINAL 5 are removing one.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) This looks like a pickup, not a burglary. But how would an independent crew get involved in a smuggling operation like this?\n\n**PAGE SIX – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide shot of Criminal 3 holding the door open. Behind him, Nightwing’s hand is reaching out of the darkness.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Let’s find out.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCriminal 3’s legs are kicking out of the door as he’s pulled back into the dark.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from the floor, next to a brown dress shoe, angled up at Criminal 4 and Criminal 5, still pulling a crate out from the shelf.\n\n**Panel Four**\nTwo-shot between Criminal 4 and Criminal 5. The shoe belongs to a man in a trench coat and a fedora, his face obscured in shadow. He’s jerking a thumb over his shoulder and the two criminals are drawing knives from their belts.\n\n**Panel Five**\nNightwing has Criminal 3 in a chokehold in the corner.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Alright, friend. I think it’s time for a-\n\n**Panel Six**\nNightwing looks up, his eyes widening.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a wide panel.\n\n**Panel One**\nPull back and to the right a little as Criminal 4 lunges from the left and embeds his knife in the wall. Nightwing is dodging to the right.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Criminal 4’s face as Nightwing kicks him in the jaw.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: Isn’t this usually the part where you say “Not so fast, masked man!” –\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull back out. Criminal 3 is slumped in the corner. Criminal 4 is sprawling and holding his jaw. Nightwing is kicking Criminal 5’s knife out of his hand.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: -- Or maybe, “I’ll get him, boss!”?\n\n**Panel Four**\nMove back in behind Nightwing as he delivers a right hook to Criminal 5’s face.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: Henchmen are just no *fun* anymo-\n\n**Panel Five**\nA crate lands on top of Nightwing from above.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – FOUR PANELS**\nEach panel is full-width.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle. Nightwing is lying face-down. The crate has fallen over onto its side and the lid has flown off. We can see that it’s full of assault rifles. CRIMINAL 6 is kneeling on top of the shelf the crate fell from. Criminal 2 is leaning through the door.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Well, that hurts. A lot.\n\n2. CRIMINAL 2: The hell happened in here?!\n\n**Panel Two**\nShow Criminal 2 on the left and Criminal 6 on the right from behind, dragging Nightwing by the arms between two shelves towards their mysterious LEADER, who is facing an open loading door facing the docks.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Woozy. Head is pounding.\n\n2. CRIMINAL 2: You idiot. If you damaged the merchandize, the boss’ll skin you alive.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Hey, they *did* mention “the boss.”\n\n**Panel Three**\nAngle from above as Nightwing is pulled up behind the leader.\n\n1. LEADER: I thought it might be you snoopin’ around…\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup from the side as the leader leans backwards towards Nightwing. He’s wearing a neck brace and a set of high-tech goggles that wrap around to the back of his head. This probably has something to do with the fact that is head is facing 180 degrees from the rest of his body. This is TORQUE.\n\n1. TORQUE: ***… Lad!***\n\n2 .NIGHTWING: Torque!\n\n**PAGE NINE – THREE PANELS**\nThe panels are arranged with two on top and one on the bottom. The lines form an upside-down “Y” shape, sort of like a peace sign.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over Nightwing’s shoulder; he’s still being restrained. Torque has stepped forward (away) a little and thrown his arms wide.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Makes sense. He broke loose recently and went to ground. Maybe hooking back up with his Intergang buddies?\n\n2. TORQUE: Surprised t’*see* me, Boyo?\n\n3. NIGHTWING: If this is a set-up for a “hindsight” pun, save it. I figured you’d be back…\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same angle. The two criminals holding Nightwing start convulsing, with some electrical sparks flying. Nightwing is catching Torque in the nose with a high kick.\n\n1. TORQUE: (SFX) Uhn!\n\n2. SFX: BZZT! BZZT!\n\n3. NIGHTWING: … And it looks like *my* turn to disappear!\n\n4. NIGHTWING: (Cap) *Assuming* I can actually pull this off.\n\n5. NIGHTWING: (Cap) (Next to Criminal 2) Microtasers built into telescoping collapsible Escrima sticks stowed in my gauntlet compartments.\n\n6. NIGHTWING: (Cap) (Next to Criminal 6) Short version, my stick thingies go *zap* and so do my hands now.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from in front of Nightwing as he makes a break for the door to the docks. In the background, Torque has risen to his knees and is reaching into his coat.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) That box took a lot out of me. I should be faster than—\n\n**PAGE TEN – SPLASH**\nLow angle. Nightwing is stumbling and yelling at the edge of the dock. Torque has pulled out a huge revolver and fired three times. We see the paths of the bullets. One is passing over Nightwing’s right shoulder and another under his left arm, but the third is punching directly through his left shoulder.\n\n1. SFX: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nPanel One is a splash, so to speak. The remaining panels are wide and short, stacked one on top of the other beneath Panel One.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from underwater as Nightwing falls in, head-first. Blood is pooling out from his shoulder wound.\n\n**Panel Two**\nView from the surface. We see an extreme closeup of Nightwing’s face as he floats to the surface. He’s unconscious.\n\n**Panel Three**\nOur view stays in place as Nightwing is carried away by the current. It brings him out to a closeup…\n\n**Panel Four**\n… A wide shot…\n\n**Panel Five**\n… And a speck in the distance.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a large panel, and another row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nExtreme closeup on Dick. He’s asleep, but no longer in the water.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHe wakes with a gasp.\n\n**Panel Three**\nDick sits up. He’s in a bedroom, nicer than his apartment but significantly more cluttered. A few personal articles (mostly books) are piled in a corner in a hasty attempt at cleaning. A nightstand next to the bed has a digital clock and a few pictures on it, but they’re facing away from us. He’s shirtless, bandages wrapped around his injured shoulder. A neatly-folded stack of clothes rests at the foot of the bed. There’s a note on top of them.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Where the hell-?\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Oh, I *do* know this place. But how did I *get* here?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Dick’s hand holding the note. It’s handwritten.\n\n1. NOTE: Pretty sure these are your size. Your *other* clothes are drying. And have a *hole* in them.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWe see over his shoulder as he turns to look at the nightstand. One of the photos is of Dick himself, smiling sheepishly in his police uniform. Another is of a young BARBARA GORDON embracing her father, JIM GORDON. The third features Barbara, somewhat older and in a wheelchair, next to DINAH LANCE, who has her arm around Barbara’s shoulders in what appears to be an uncomfortably tight squeeze. The clock reads 10:47 PM.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA large establishing shot, a row of three, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nDick’s leaning in the bedroom door. Outside, we see the interior of the CLOCKTOWER. Aside from the gears of the clock, the apartment is fairly ordinary, if more spacious than typical, and with most of the furniture piled with miscellaneous books and paperwork. Electrical wires crisscross along the walls, attached by tape. On the far side, a set of computer monitors are attached to a large desktop machine. Using the computer is Barbara. She’s turning in her wheelchair to face Dick.\n\n1. DICK: Alright, I give up. How’d I get here?\n\n2. BARBARA: You’re awake!\n\n3. DICK: Which I’m guessing means it’s *not* still Wednesday.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Barbara, hands folded in her lap.\n\n1. BARBARA: Early this morning, I saw your suit tracer in Gotham, out in the middle of Rogers Yacht Basin. I couldn’t get through, so I figured something was wrong and sent Robin to fish you out.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Dick.\n\n1. DICK: Well, thank goodness for Big Brother.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle. Barbara’s stuffed Nightwing doll is hitting Dick in the head.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWide shot of the kitchen. Barbara is pouring coffee into a pair of mugs on the kitchen table. Dick is moving a hefty-looking computer parts catalogue off of a chair nearby.\n\n1. DICK: I think the shirt’s a size too small, by the way.\n\n2. BARBARA: Believe me, I *noticed*.\n\n3. BARBARA: Seriously, how are you?\n\n**Panel Six**\nAnother closeup on Dick, rubbing his shoulder.\n\n1. DICK: Doesn’t hurt too bad, other than my pride, my sleep schedule, and-*Ow!*-my shoulder.\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nOne column.\n\n**Panel One**\nTwo-shot of Dick and Barbara across the table from one another.\n\n1. BARBARA: What happened, anyway?\n\n2. DICK: Routine mission. Just took a couple lucky shots.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Barbara. She has a concerned frown on her face.\n\n1. BARBARA: Just be careful, all right? It can be easy to forget how… *fragile* we are.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe same two-shot from Panel One. They’re both staring down into their mugs.\n\n**Panel Four**\nPull in a little as Barbara moves around the table to place a hand on Dick’s shoulder.\n\n1. BARBARA: Hey. Hey! *No moping.* I’ll do that on my *own* time. I’m just glad you’re all right.\n\n**Panel Five**\nPull in just a little more as Dick holds her hand and smiles at her.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of three, a row of two, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Barbara.\n\n1. BARBARA: How soon do you have to get home?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Dick, smiling apologetically.\n\n1. DICK: I missed a day of work already. If I go tonight, I can still grab a couple hours of sleep before I go in tomorrow.\n\n2. DICK: Unless you need me here?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on their hands.\n\n1. BARBARA: I certainly wouldn’t *mind* your staying over… but Bruce needs me on standby. The Dynamic Duo are looking into this thing* at Gothcorp.\n\n2. CAPTION: *A “thing” detailed in the all-new smash Batman #1 – read it today! – Self-PromotingJamags\n\n**Panel Four**\nAnother closeup of Dick, pulled in a little tighter than the last.\n\n1. DICK: Maybe I *should* stay a while. For… luck.\n\n**Panel Five**\nTwo-shot. Dick and Barbara kiss.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe same angle. They’ve pulled apart, smiling.\n\n1. BARBARA: I feel luckier already.\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid. The borders are somewhat blurred, indicating a flashback.\n\n**Panel One**\nBATGIRL is running towards the reader along a rooftop. BATMAN is swinging in from the upper left, and ROBIN from the upper right. Their poses imitate the cover of Detective Comics #359, but with Batman further away and slightly blurred.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) When the Batgirl first showed up, I guess I developed sort of a kiddie crush on her. She was a little old for me and I honestly didn’t even think she knew.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) My first mistake. Babs knows *everything*.\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe TEEN TITANS are posing for a photograph. AQUALAD and SPEEDY are in the back, standing. Speedy is holding two fingers up behind Aqualad’s head, and Aqualad is glaring at him. Robin is kneeling in the front, with his arms around the shoulders of WONDER GIRL and KID FLASH, also kneeling.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) We fell out of contact after I first joined the Titans.\n\n**Panel Three**\nA similarly-framed shot of the NEW TEEN TITANS. In the back, JERICHO is waving, RAVEN’s arms are folded dignifiedly behind her back, and CYBORG is grabbing CHANGELING by the wrist, preventing him from imitating Speedy’s maneuver from the previous panel. Kneeling in the front, Nightwing, wearing his cheesy ‘80s costume with the disco collar, is kissing STARFIRE. They’re still flanked by Wonder Girl and Kid Flash.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Before long I had other things on my mind.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBarbara is in a hospital bed, staring distantly in the reader’s direction. Dick is sitting on the far side of the bed in civilian clothes.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Babs and I talked a little after her injury, but there… wasn’t much to say.\n\n**Panel Five**\nNightwing, now in his yellow ‘90s costume (though thankfully sans accompanying mullet), is seated alone on a bridge overlooking Titans Island.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) The second Titans team went their separate ways. The breakup was messy.\n\n**Panel Five**\nTwo-shot of Barbara showing Dick a sketch of the Oracle logo and gesturing at the Clocktower in the background.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I didn’t really have anywhere to go except back to Gotham. When I came back, Babs was… different. Not quite happier, but *motivated*.\n\n**Panel Six**\nOver-the-shoulder shot of Barbara turning to look at Nightwing, now in the modern blue-striped suit, leaning in the doorway with his arms folded and feet crossed.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) We didn’t actually start seeing each other until *after* I’d left for the ‘Haven. I didn’t think I was ready for another relationship, but when she *did* start to smile again… I just couldn’t resist.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – SPLASH**\nWide shot of Nightwing, standing on the roof of the Clocktower. We can tell he’s still in Gotham because the skyline is dominated by a skyscraper with the word “WAYNE” in large neon letters.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I guess that brings you up to date.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Off-panel) We could’ve used you tonight.\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – THREE PANELS**\nInvert the layout of Page Nine so the “Y” is right-side-up.\n\n**Panel One**\nNightwing turns. BATMAN is standing behind him, partially illuminated by moonlight.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: Babs-\n\n2. BATMAN: (SFX) Ahem.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: *Oracle* said you had things under control.\n\n4. BATMAN: I *thought* I did.\n\n**Panel Two**\nPull into a two-shot as Batman approaches and places a hand on Nightwing’s shoulder.\n\n1. BATMAN: But what I mean is that you’re always welcome here, Nightwing.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: I appreciate that.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe same shot. Batman has lowered his hand.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Bruce has mellowed out a *lot* in the last few years, and any bad blood between us is ancient history.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) But *God*, it’s still so *awkward* sometimes.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nA wide shot and a row of two. Panel Four is inset in the corner of Panel Three.\n\n**Panel One**\nSimilar framing to the Page Seventeen splash, but Batman is standing next to Nightwing.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I mean, it’s not like I can just say “Hey, dad, let’s go bowling!” or something.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Not unless we use deranged Arkham escapees as the pins.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Actually, that has possibilities.\n\n4. BATMAN: I imagine you’ll be heading back to Blüdhaven before long.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBatman is in the foreground, still looking out at the city. Nightwing is turning toward him in the background.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: Probably should’ve left a while ago.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: Actually, I was hoping to see you before I left.\n\n**Panel Three**\nMirrored shot from the last one, with Batman now turning to look at Nightwing.\n\n1. BATMAN: Thank you, Di- Nightwing.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I feel like we should hug, but… he’s still not much of a hugger.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Nightwing.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: *Actually,* I did need *one* thing…\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nNightwing is riding the BATCYCLE down the freeway. A sign on the far side of the road says “GOTHAM – 11 MI.”\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe see him still riding, now from behind. This angle shows another sign, this one saying “WELCOME TO BLÜDHAVEN.” Graffiti has been spray-painted over the word Blüdhaven, making it appear to be on fire.\n\n**Panel Three**\nNightwing is climbing in through his apartment window, taking his mask off.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I can still manage a few hours’ worth of zees before I’m due at the station.\n\n**Panel Four**\nDick, now in pajamas, is sitting on the side of his bed and yawning, stretching his arms in the air.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Even superheroes need their beauty sleep. Just don’t tell Bruce.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – FOUR PANELS**\nPanel One is inset in Panel Two, which takes up most of the page. Panels Three and Four are a row at the bottom.\n\n**Panel One**\nDick, in uniform again, is standing in front of the steps of a large building. Above the door are the words “POLICE HEADQUARTERS.”\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) OK. Time to face the music. I *think* I’ve got a decent alibi.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot through the door of Dick entering the building and finding a scene of absolute mayhem. Officers are rushing hurriedly to-and-fro around the lobby. The receptionist is holding two phones, with a third jammed in the crook of his neck. The waiting area is crowded with visitors, several of them visibly injured. A crying baby appears to be entirely unattended.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) What *now?*\n\n**Panel Three**\nTwo-shot of Dick trying to stop another uniformed officer.\n\n1. DICK: Hey, Drew, what’s going-\n\n**Panel Four**\nDREW pulls away and continues on his way, leaving Dick in the dust.\n\n1. DICK: -on?\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – FIVE PANELS**\nA short, wide panel, a row of three, and a closing panel taking up about half the page.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup of Amy, pushing through the crowd and yelling.\n\n1. AMY: ***GRAYSON!*** Where the holy *Hell* have you *been?!*\n\n**Panel Two**\nDick holds up his hands.\n\n1. DICK: Sorry, Sarge, I just had a-\n\n**Panel Three**\nAmy grabs Dick by the wrist and drags him along back towards the door.\n\n1. AMY: Actually, I don’t care. Come on, we’ve got an active firefight on Broadway and Fourth!\n\n2. DICK: What is *happening* here, Amy?!\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup of Amy rubbing her temple and looking frustrated.\n\n1. AMY: You don’t even *know?*\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup of Dick, jaw agape.\n\n1. AMY: (Off-panel) We’re in the middle of the biggest *gang war* in *decades.*\n\n2.

A red sports car with a broken driver side window is tearing down a Blüdhaven street towards the reader. A terrified pedestrian leaps out of the way in the foreground The driver is wearing a ski mask. The passenger side window is open and a second man in a ski mask is leaning out with a pistol. He’s firing back at one of several police cars giving chase in the background.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Caption) This is the third call like this today.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) It’s ten in the morning.\n\n3. TITLE: THE FALL OF BLÜDHAVEN PART II – FIRST BLÜD\n\n**PAGE TWO – FIVE PANELS**\nVertical stack, but the borders are at a slight angle.\n\n**Panel One**\nInside the squad car, the windshield is cracking under a glancing blow from the bullet on the passenger side. The driver is AMY ROHRBACH, accompanied by her partner and our hero, DICK GRAYSON. Dick is flinching.\n\n1. SFX: Ptt! KRRKT!\n\n2. AMY: Care to tell me just where the hell you *were* yesterday?\n\n3. DICK: Now?!\n\n**Panel Two**\nView from above of the car weaving through traffic to get closer to the sports car.\n\n1. AMY: You don’t get to complain; you’re not the one driving!\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I mean, I *guess* it’s not as bad as Bruce’s driving, but I *expect* this with him.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Dick, at enough of an angle that we can see the side mirror getting knocked off by a blurry shape, possibly a streetlight or a tree.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) *And* I knew the Batmobile was *up* to it. But this old Crown Vic?\n\n2. DICK: I ran into some muggers down on the boardwalk on my way home.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThis angle is from outside the car, so we can see Amy in the background.\n\n1. DICK: One pulls a gun, clips me, I go in the water. Went to the hospital to get patched up, but my phone got fried in the drink.\n\n**Panel Five**\nAngle from behind the police car. It’s swerving into an alley while the sports car continues on straight.\n\n1. AMY: You probably got caught in the beginning of *this* whole mess.\n\n2. DICK: Hey, where are you going?!\n\n3. AMY: Shortcut, Grayson. Where do you *think?*\n\n**PAGE THREE – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nTwo-shot through the windshield.\n\n1. DICK: And what *is* this ‘mess,’ anyway?\n\n2. AMY: Gang war.\n\n3. DICK: I got that part, but *who?* Are Blo- the Marins and the Minhs going at it all of a sudden?\n\n4. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Gotta watch what I say. Angel Marin may be dead, but that doesn’t mean most people know it’s *Blockbuster* who replaced him.\n\n**Panel Two**\nA low angle of the car rounding a dangerously tight corner.\n\n1. AMY: Seems like they’re as surprised as we are. *These* clowns seem to be foreign. They set up shop all across the docks overnight.\n\n2. DICK: Like Gotham-foreign or another-country-foreign?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Amy, driving with gritted teeth.\n\n1. AMY: How should *I* know?\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from the back seat as they swerve back out onto a main road.\n\n1. AMY: Then there’s all the prisoners who got loose from Lockhaven a couple months back…\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Unless I miss my guess, that’s probably where *Torque* got his henchmen.\n\n3. AMY: … And I’ve heard reports of some other faction that’s packing military-grade hardware.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – THREE PANELS**\nA row of one and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from above. The sports car, driving down the same road, T-bones the police car from the left.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot of the sports car from the hood. We can see the two criminals pinned behind airbags, trying to struggle free.\n\n**Panel Three**\nTurning 180 degrees, we see Amy rolling down her window and holding up her gun. Dick is stumbling out the other side.\n\n1. AMY: You’re under arrest.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – TWELVE PANELS**\nThree-by-four grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nDick and Amy are crouched behind a squad car with a few other officers, exchanging shots with two men in body armor who are shooting out a window.\n\n1. CAPTION: 11:00.\n\n**Panel Two**\nDick and Amy are sitting in a booth at a fast food restaurant. Dick is taking a bite out of a burger while Amy is dropping a French fry. Three masked criminals are bursting in and brandishing guns.\n\n1. CAPTION: 12:00.\n\n**Panel Three**\nAnother shot from inside the car. Amy is swerving out of the way of gunfire from LADY VIC, who is covering for STALLION, who in turn is ripping open the doors of a police van to release THRILLDEVIL.\n\n1. CAPTION: 1:00.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe two are now standing next to a fire truck, as the FIRE CHIEF gesticulates at a burning building in the background.\n\n1. CAPTION: 2:00.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle. Amy is looking around confusedly. The fire has clearly gotten much worse. In the background, Nightwing is emerging from the building with a child in his arms.\n\n1. CAPTION: 3:00.\n\n**Panel Six**\nA narrow street. Two gangs in different colors are scattering into opposite alleys, taking parting shots at each other as police cars approach in the background.\n\n1. CAPTION: 4:00.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nShot from the back seat of the car. They’re in a drive-through. The car ahead of them has pulled up to the window and the driver is threatening the worker inside with a gun. Dick is stepping out of the car while Amy has her head in her hands.\n\n1. CAPTION: 5:00.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nA man in a suit is yelling at Dick and Amy and gesticulating at a warehouse in the background which has had the doors ripped open and been partially emptied.\n\n1. CAPTION: 6:00.\n\n**Panel Nine**\nDick and Amy are pulling apart two angry-looking men with knives.\n\n1. CAPTION: 7:00.\n\n**Panel Ten**\nCloseup on a teenager, about to throw a brick at something. Dick’s hand is reaching in to grab his throwing arm.\n\n1. CAPTION: 8:00.\n\n**Panel Eleven**\nA purse snatcher is running towards the reader. The panel is framed by Dick and Amy, standing with their arms folded. The purse snatcher is looking over his shoulder and doesn’t notice that he’s running straight into them.\n\n1. CAPTION: 9:00.\n\n**Panel Twelve**\nDick and Amy are sprawled on chairs at the station, exhausted.\n\n1. CAPTION: 10:00.\n\n**PAGE SIX – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nBack in Dick’s apartment, he’s in his Nightwing suit but still unmasked, chugging from a large Sundollars coffee cup.\n\n1. CAPTION: Midnight.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Holy marathon. What a *day.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup of Nightwing putting his mask on.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) And *if* today was any indication, I’m not going to have much chance to investigate this stuff unless I keep moving.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot over Nightwing’s shoulder as he climbs out his window.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) And as Bruce says—without so much as a *hint* of irony, mind you—crime *never* sleeps.\n\n**Panel Four**\nNightwing is silhouetted in the foreground, crouched on a sloped rooftop. He’s looking down at a very large, very fancy house. Men with guns are patrolling the yard and roof of the other house.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) First stop, Avalon, to check up on Freddie Minh.\n\n**Panel Five**\nA closeup of a large third-floor window in the house. Through the window, we can see MADAME MINH, staring into the distance.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Or rather, Freddie Minh’s *wife,* who I recently learned killed the man himself years ago and has been running his operations.\n\n**Panel Six**\nLow angle of Nightwing. One of his gauntlet panels is flipped open, revealing a touch screen, on which he’s typing.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) These guys are jumpy, but they look like they’re *expecting* an attack, not planning one.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) They’ve turned this place into a fortress.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide shot of Blockbuster’s mansion. It’s not as large as Madame Minh’s, but just as expensive and more modern in styling. Henchmen with assault rifles are prowling the hillside in groups of four.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Roland “Blockbuster” Desmond’s house, conversely, is *always* a fortress.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot through the living room window, framed as if through binoculars. BLOCKBUSTER is standing in the middle of the room, pointing his finger and yelling at Thrilldevil, who is shrinking into a corner, clearly terrified. Lady Vic and Stallion are waiting in the doorway. Stallion looks a little nervous, while Lady Vic is mostly just amused.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) There’s *some* of the usual muscle.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe binocular view moves up to the roof. BRUTALE and ELECTROCUTIONER are on opposite sides, looking outwards.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Another two keeping watch. Strange that they aren’t out stirring up trouble.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Nightwing. He’s in a tree, lowering his binoculars with one hand. The touch screen is open on the other.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Who are we missing? Mouse and Giz are probably inside, but I *really* don’t like not knowing where *Shrike* is.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – SIX PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of three, and a large shot taking up roughly half of the page.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot through the front window of a convenience store. Four men in prison coveralls are loading duffel bags with merchandise. A fifth is threatening the cashier with a gun.\n\n1. LEAD PRISONER: *Give me the %@#$ing cash, bro!*\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) And here’re our Lockhaven friends. I was *wondering* where some of these guys got to after the fire.\n\n**Panel Two**\nPull in just slightly, centering on the gun. The cashier is fumbling with cash from the register.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Come on, just give me an opening…\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on the armed prisoner. He’s raised the weapon towards the ceiling as he shovels cash into his duffel bag.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Bingo.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle. Nightwing’s grapnel line is breaking through the window.\n\n1. SFX: Chkkt!\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle. The hook has latched onto the armed prisoner’s gun arm. The prisoner has just now noticed it.\n\n1. ARMED PRISONER: Buh?\n\n**Panel Six**\nLow angle in front of the window, shattering as the prisoner is yanked through by the line.\n\n1. SFX: KRRRRSSSSSSSSH!\n\n**PAGE NINE – SIX PANELS**\nThe first and sixth panels take up most of the page, separated by four small inserts.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe armed criminal is stumbling to his feet, but Nightwing is knocking him out with an escrima stick.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: Now, can I take the *others* out before things get hairy?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on a second prisoner, getting kicked in the face by Nightwing.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on a third prisoner, getting knocked out by a backhanded swing.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on a fourth prisoner, being dragged across a shelf full of various snack foods.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on a fifth prisoner, looking terrified as he’s shoved up against a refrigerator.\n\n**Panel Six**\nAngle from the side of Nightwing doing his best Batman snarl at the fifth prisoner.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Yeah, I can take them.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: These jobs are coordinated. Who’s leading the escapees?!\n\n3. FIFTH PRISONER: N-nobody, man! That backwards-head guy just told us to go nuts!\n\n4. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I was afraid of that. Probably a smokescreen for some other move.\n\n**PAGE TEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over Nightwing’s shoulder. He’s now on a rooftop corner. He’s looking down at a street that leads out to the docks. Six sour-looking henchmen in leather jackets are standing around trying to look inconspicuous.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Now we’re getting to the tricky stuff. These new guys at the docks don’t look like the brightest bulbs, but there are a *ton* of them.\n\n**Panel Two**\nLow angle of another leather jacketed henchman leaning against a fence and smoking. In the background is a warehouse of similar design to the one where Nightwing fought Torque last issue.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Hm. Unless my Chinese is rustier than I thought, those jackets say “Ghost Dragons.” Tim’s bumped into these guys his share of times. I wonder…\n\n**Panel Three**\nWe see Nightwing’s hands in the foreground, holding onto a line. His feet are also kicking into the edge of the panel as he swings towards another warehouse rooftop. In the distance, more henchmen are milling around, but this group are wearing raincoats.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Huh. *These* aren’t Ghost Dragons. Not even Chinese.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from the ground. Nightwing is grabbing a LOOKOUT who was stationed on the roof from behind.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Let’s see if this guy’s feeling talkative.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup. Nightwing is holding his captive by the scruff of the neck.\n\n1. LOOKOUT: Bloody hell!\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I guess I know where they’re *from* now.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: Evening, sir.\n\n**Panel Two**\nA wider shot. The lookout is struggling ineffectually.\n\n1. LOOKOUT: I knew they shouldn’t have sent us here! Daft Yankee cape.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: Well, this daft Yankee cape would like to know who “they” are, and I’m sure you’d like to keep your teeth, so maybe we can work something out.\n\n3. LOOKOUT: &*@@#% off!\n\n4. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Maybe I shouldn’t have led with the *teeth.*\n\n**Panel Three**\nBoth of them look at the edge of the roof.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (From over the edge) OI! JAKE! WHERE ARE YOU?!\n\n**Panel Four**\nNightwing looks back at Jake.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: Sounds like you’re missed. If you’re smarter than you look, I was never here.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Well, *this* has been a productive evening.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nAnother over-the-shoulder shot of Nightwing spying, this time on a modest three-story apartment building.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Some of the Rambo wannabes with the heavy gear are holed up here.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot through a window of a few rugged-looking men in grey coveralls watching TV and drinking beer.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Figured they’d need somewhere cheap and inconspicuous where they could store a bunch of suspicious gear, and without being bothered by their rivals.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Nightwing, frowning.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Melville is perfect. I’d know; it’s why *I’m* headquartered here.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from behind again. He’s standing up and pulling out his grapnel gun.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) And like hell am I going to let these guys set up shop in *my* backyard.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SEVEN PANELS**\nAlmost a two-by-four grid, but with Panel Three being full-width.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle of Nightwing swinging over onto the roof of the building.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) There I go throwing around possessive adjectives again.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Treating it like my *turf.* Reminds me of No Man’s Land.\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same angle. Nightwing has landed in a crouch directly in front of the reader.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) God willing, it won’t get that bad he-\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull back so we can see a little sensor gizmo in the background pointed at Nightwing.\n\n1. SFX: (From over the edge of the roof, presumably coming from a window) Eep! Eep!\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Holy tinfoil hats, who puts *motion sensors* on the roof of an *apartment building?*\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot over his shoulder as he looks at the stairwell entrance.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I mean *other* than me.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) And Babs.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) And Helena.\n\n4. SFX: (From off-panel) Eep! Eep! Eep!\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe angle hasn’t changed, but Nightwing has moved, pulling himself up on top of the stairwell entrance.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: And, I mean, you could count Titans Tower as an apartment building after a fashion.\n\n2. SFX: (From off-panel) Eep! Eep! Eep!\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe angle holds. Three men with body armor and assault rifles are bursting out of the door. They’re wearing balaclavas with skull patterns and have bird wings painted on their helmets.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: Is it me? Am I just an unintentional purveyor of residential paranoia?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nThe paramilitary goons have advanced further onto the roof. Nightwing is landing on top of one of them. We can see that he’s drawn his escrima sticks.\n\n1. LEAD SOLDIER: Empty? Could’ve sworn…\n\n2. SOLDIER 2: (SFX) Uff!\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Maybe it’s fashionable in the Gotham-Blüdhaven corridor. Like a good luck charm to keep the supervillains out.\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh angle, on the whole group. Nightwing is lunging to the third soldier and jabbing him with the escrima sticks. We see a couple electric sparks.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I am loving these tasers.\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe pull into a tighter closeup as the lead soldier whirls and hits Nightwing in the left shoulder with the butt of his gun.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Did I ever mention how I started usi-\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Covering part of the first caption) UHN!\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Damn, that’s my bad shoulder.\n\n**Panel Three**\nDrop down to a low angle as Nightwing kicks the gun out of the lead soldier’s hand. The second is still crumpled on the ground and the third is off-panel.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Broke my concentration.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) These guys aren’t exactly Slade Wilson, but they’re not bad, either. Focus on disarming.\n\n**Panel Four**\nSpin the shot around so we’re looking past the lead soldier towards Nightwing. The third soldier has already recovered and has grabbed Nightwing in a chokehold. The leader is picking up his weapon. Off to the side, we see the second soldier struggling to his feet.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Armor must’ve been insulated. Losing control. Got to-\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – SPLASH**\nLow angle. Everyone is basically in the same positions, but we’ve moved back behind Nightwing and the third soldier. The lead soldier is starting to aim, but we can see the path of a BULLET passing directly between his eyes.\n\n1. SFX: ***BANG!***\n\n2. NIGHTWING: ***Holy bullseye!***\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA large panel with an insert and two rows of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from above of the dead lead soldier.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Sniper.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Someone fancies themselves a guardian angel.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Which means now I have to protect *these* goons from *my* rescuer.\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup of Nightwing jamming an escrima stick into the third soldier’s knee.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) This guy didn’t try to disarm me.\n\n**Panel Three**\nNightwing is grabbing the second soldier by the shoulders.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Probably figured I’d be *dead* before it mattered.\n\n**Panel Four**\nNightwing is throwing the second soldier down the stairs through the open stairwell door.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Lucky me.\n\n2. SFX: Clatter! Clunk! Crash!\n\n**Panel Five**\nBoth Nightwing and our view turn to face the third soldier, who’s going for his gun. Nightwing is launching his grapnel line at him.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Don’t think I’ve forgotten about *you,* friend. We need you out of sight too.\n\n**Panel Six**\nNightwing yanks the third soldier into cover at the top of the stairs. His gun doesn’t come with him.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a large central panel, and another row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup of Nightwing holding the third soldier against the wall.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: I need information. Tell me what I want to hear and I’ll throw you down the stairs with your sleepy friend. Don’t, and I’ll throw you outside with your *dead* friend.\n\n2. SOLDIER 3: That’s not how you capes work.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: Good thing I’m not *wearing* a cape.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on the third soldier, shrugging.\n\n1. SOLDIER 3: Easy! Easy! Never said I wouldn’t talk.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: That’s better. Who *are* you people? Who do you work for?\n\n**Panel Three**\nLow angle past the lead soldier’s body, into the doorway where Nightwing has the third soldier pinned.\n\n1. SOLDIER 3: Second question first. That OK with you?\n\n2. NIGHTWING: Peachy. Get to it.\n\n3. SOLDIER 3: Crazy broad calls herself “Archangel.” *We’re* the “Angels of Death.” If the money’s good, she can call us the Teletubbies for all I care.\n\n**Panel Four**\nSimilar shot from next to the second Angel at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: You’re *mercs?* What’s the mission, then?\n\n2. ANGEL 3: Archangel wants to ruin some guy called *Blockbuster’s* day. She says jump, we jump. Otherwise, we’re just raising hell on her dime. ‘Sall I got, promise.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same shot. The third Angel lands next to his comrade.\n\n1. SFX: THUD!\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I believe him.\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of three, and a large panel taking up about half the page.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle. Nightwing is crouching next to the dead Angel.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Entry angle and positioning suggests the shot came from…\n\n**Panel Two**\nClose in to look over Nightwing’s shoulder as he turns to face a somewhat taller building across the street.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Over there.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from the taller building. Nightwing is climbing up onto the roof.\n\n**Panel Four**\nPull back as he stands up. The roof is empty. We can see a little piece of paper next to his foot, but he hasn’t noticed it yet.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Nothing. Looks like my friend already split.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Nightwing, looking down towards the paper.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) … But not without leaving something behind.\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot of the note, clearly written *very* quickly, if the borderline-illegible chickenscratch is any indication. It isn’t signed, instead bearing a crude stick-figure doodle of a spider, with a winky face.\n\n1. NOTE: (Line 1) youre WELCOME\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Well, *that’s* a little creepy.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – THREE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nEstablishing shot of a large, abandoned, industrial-looking building. People, most in prison coveralls, are converging through the doors.\n\n1. ???: (From inside the building) Glad you could make it, lads!\n\n**Panel Two**\nAnother establishing shot. A large interior room with a bare floor. Around a hundred of the Lockhaven escapees are sitting on the floor or leaning against the walls. TORQUE is standing at the back, speaking.

He is throwing his arms wide, but we can see the crowd in the background. A healthy number of them look bored or confused, but most are enthusiastic.\n\n1. TORQUE: The way I see it, if they could take them apart in here, we ought to put ourselves *together* in here. And what *for*, you ask?\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – TWO PANELS**\nA small insert and a splash.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot of a few members of the crowd, listening intently.\n\n1. TORQUE: In fact, I guess you could say this town was *built* on whaling.\n\n**Panel Two**\nLow angle on Torque from the crowd. A huge grin splits his face.\n\n1.

Sunlight glints off a nearby window, obscuring the appearance of whatever passenger is inside. It’s smaller than you’d expect relative to the city it’s approaching. But then, who’d want to fly here, now?\n\n1. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: As the telltale lurching of an airplane in descent awakened me from a fitful sleep, I idly attempted to devise a scenario in which one would be *glad* to approach that quintessence of urban decay known as Blüdhaven.\n\n2. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: I failed.\n\n**PAGE TWO – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nInside the airport, two grey-haired men, both in good shape but one much taller than the other, shuffle through a mostly empty hallway towards a sign saying BAGGAGE CLAIM. One or two other stragglers from the same flight are visible.\n\n1. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: Nevertheless, my companion insisted we come, and so we found ourselves in “Gotham’s ugly older sister,” as Alan Wayne once called it in his memoirs.\n\n2. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: This, by the way, was his attempt to pay the city a compliment.\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe two are now exiting the terminal. We’re still behind them. They’re traveling light, each with just a briefcase. There’s a slight shadow on a rooftop some distance from the door.\n\n1. TALL MAN: I’ll give them one thing; we’ve already picked up a tail.\n\n2. SHORT MAN: We did? Oh, yes, I see. Overly fond of rooftops, aren’t they?\n\n3. TALL MAN: I never *got* that. Lousy terrain. Too many changes in elevation to move around all that fast.\n\n4. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: If you’ve been reading my musings thus far, I imagine you’ve grown rather tired of my praising his instincts, and yet *I* never tire of *doing* so.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on the tall man’s hand, pointing.\n\n1. TALL MAN: (Off-panel) Let’s grab a taxi. We’ll lose him on foot when we pick up *our* wheels.\n\n2.

NIGHTWING: (Cap) Not my *favorite* disguise for the ol’ Nightmobile, but it’s inconspicuous around here.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) No, I don’t actually call it the Nightmobile.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Though now that I think about it…\n\n**Panel Two**\nLow angle of the taxi turning out onto the street. Its windows are tinted black.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Have to be careful, but *how* careful?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Nightwing in the driver’s seat.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) *Weirdly* sloppy of him. Got sighted by airport security three airports ago. Convinced them it was mistaken identity, but the Batcomputer flagged his itinerary. Coming here *can’t* be coincidence.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from Nightwing’s POV of the taxi carrying the two men.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) So *maybe* he’s losing his touch in his old age.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Maybe he’s leading me into some sort of elaborate trap.\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Maybe he doesn’t think I’m dangerous enough to even *bother* avoiding me.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from above as the two taxis approach a parking garage.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) What if he’s counting on my second-guessing myself so much I won’t be *able* to track him?\n\n**PAGE FOUR – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nNightwing is standing in the middle of the parking garage. It’s empty.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) *Or* he just had a plan to lose me.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: Damn it. What’s he *doing?*\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe’re inside a sedan. Clean and a relatively new model, but nothing expensive. We’re looking from the rear seats between the two men in the airport in the front. The short man is driving.\n\n1. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: After making efficient work of avoiding the city’s costumed protector, we approached our destination. If anything, he was growing *more* tense.\n\n2. SHORT MAN: Something bothering you?\n\n3. TALL MAN: Nightwing’s a known quantity. I don’t know *what* to make of Archangel. Could be dangerous, could be a pushover.\n\n**Panel Three**\nWe see from the driver’s seat as the tall man exits and the short man circles around the front of the car. In the background is a completely unremarkable brownstone.\n\n1. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: As we approached, it seemed my friend’s reputation preceded him.\n\n**Panel Four**\nA security guard in a suit looks up from the front desk of the building, fear in his eyes.\n\n1. TALL MAN: (Off-panel) I’m here to talk to Archangel.\n\n2. SECURITY GUARD: I don’t th-think you ca- I mean, th-there’s no one here- I mean-\n\n3. TALL MAN: (Off-panel) I’m here.\n\n4. TALL MAN: (Off-panel) To talk.\n\n5. TALL MAN: (Off-panel) To Archangel.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – SPLASH**\nWe’re looking over the security guard’s shoulder. In the background, we see the short man is in his ‘60s with a well-groomed handlebar mustache. Most of the page, however, is dedicated to the tall man. He appears to be in his ‘50s, with a goatee and an eyepatch. \n\n1. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: I should have expected a *mercenary* outfit to be familiar with…\n\n2.

BLÜD MONEY\n\n**PAGE SIX – FOUR PANELS**\nA row of three along the top and a splash.\n\n**Panel One**\nTwo ANGELS OF DEATH are backing up nervously towards a door.\n\n1. ANGEL 1: W-we should try to stop him, right?\n\n2. ANGEL 2: *You* stop him.\n\n**Panel Two**\nFrom the other side of the door, which is shattering as the Angels are thrown through. SLADE WILSON follows them with a flourish of his power staff.\n\n**Panel Three**\nLow angle past the two unconscious Angels at Wilson.\n\n1. WILSON: It’s so hard to find good help these days.\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) True, but the *door* was quite expensive.\n\n**Panel Four**\nWilson’s POV. He’s just entered a *really* expensive-looking penthouse apartment, specifically a sitting room with several comfy couches and chairs arranged around a coffee table. ARCHANGEL leans casually on the arm of one couch. She’s almost hard to look at. She wears armor, the style of which closely mimics medieval plate armor, but it’s silvered, covered in ornate relief designs, and a faint white glow from some of the joints suggests that it’s not quite as archaic as it looks. Over the armor is a long, white cape which dances in a breeze from the open window, approximating a pair of wings quite effectively. She’s pulling down a hood to reveal an implausibly immaculate blonde haircut almost down to her shoulders. The look is only really disrupted by the malice in her pale blue eyes, the sneer on her face, the glass of red wine in her left hand, and… oh, yes, the assault rifle she’s pointing at Wilson with her right hand.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: Reconsidered my offer, Mister Wilson?\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – SIX PANELS**\nThree-by-two grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nWilson, clearly unimpressed, collapses his staff.\n\n1. WILSON: Not really.\n\n2. WILSON: Cadmus covers the bills. *\n\n3. CAPTION: * See recent issues of Elongated Man!\n\n**Panel Two**\nArchangel sniffs at her wine. The rifle is still trained on Wilson.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: And am I to assume *they* sent you to kill me, or is this excursion *not* business-related?\n\n**Panel Three**\nWilson is sitting down in one of the chairs.\n\n1. WILSON: *Personal* business. On a hunch, have you received a letter from an outfit calling themselves “Koning?”\n\n**Panel Four**\nArchangel has an eyebrow raised.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: Now, how would you-\n\n**Panel Five**\nShe’s smiling.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: Ah, I see. You intend to dissuade me from bidding for Nightwing’s identity.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Wilson.\n\n1. WILSON: Just the opposite, actually. I want to be sure you win.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of three and two rows of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nArchangel is actually surprised for the first time.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: Oh?\n\n2. WILSON: In fact, I’ll even cover half the cost.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Wilson.\n\n1. WILSON: One condition: Once you learn the name, you don’t release it publicly or kill him. Defensive tactics only.\n\n**Panel Three**\nArchangel again.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: A white knight stepping in on his *behalf.* I’ll admit, I wasn’t expecting that.\n\n**Panel Four**\nWilson, counting on his fingers.\n\n1. WILSON: First, I’ve got plans for the kid, and I need him intact.\n\n2. WILSON: Second, I already *know* who he is, and scarcity makes that info *valuable.*\n\n3. WINTERGREEN’S JOURNAL: In truth, Slade felt indebted to Nightwing in relation past dealings involving his children. But of course, Archangel didn’t need to know that. And neither did Nightwing.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWide shot of the two.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: Why come to me?\n\n2. WILSON: The only other serious bidder is Blockbuster. You think *he’ll* take this deal?\n\n**Panel Six**\nArchangel is snarling at just the mention of Blockbuster’s name.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: I suppose *not.*\n\n**Panel Seven**\nThe two have stood and they shake hands.\n\n1. WILSON: Then it’s a deal?\n\n2. ARCHANGEL: A generous one. A pleasure, Mister Wilson. And a shame we can’t do business otherwise.\n\n3. WILSON: For now.\n\n**PAGE NINE – FIVE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle. It’s now late afternoon. We’re looking at a large building in the middle of the city. A sign says RABE Memorial Hospital.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot through the spinning propellers of a helicopter down at a helipad on the roof.\n\n**Panel Three**\nOutside the front entrance. It’s crowded, with a lot of people coming and going.\n\n**Panel Four**\nIn a back alley, we see an emergency entrance. A nurse has it propped open with his foot as he smokes a cigarette.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe ambulance bay. An ambulance is pulling in. It’s a different model from the others in the bay and the markings are slightly different.\n\n**PAGE TEN – EIGHT PANELS**\nA row of three, two rows of one, a row of two, and a row of one. (Mirroring the previous page, but with the first and fourth rows split into multiple panels.)\n\n**Panel One**\nThree men in scrubs are wheeling someone on a stretcher out of the ambulance. The man on the stretcher is face-down.\n\n**Panel Two**\nFrom inside the ambulance. A DOCTOR is running towards the men with the stretcher. She’s brandishing a clipboard.\n\n1. DOCTOR: You left him on his *face?*\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe man in the stretcher sits up, pointing his gun at the doctor, grinning wickedly. It’s TORQUE, and we’re, uh, behind him, I guess, in the sense that his backwards head is looking at us.\n\n1. TORQUE: That’s awfully insensitive, lass.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack at the emergency exit, a few more henchmen are going in, one of them handing a wad of cash to the nurse.\n\n**Panel Five**\nInside the hospital lobby. A pick-up truck is crashing through the front door.\n\n1. SFX: KLAAAASSSSH!\n\n**Panel Six**\nBack on the roof. Another man in scrubs is trying to wave off the helicopter, which has “WBLD” written across the side.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nCloser on the helicopter. Another henchman is leaning out the door, holding a missile launcher.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nWide angle. The landing pad explodes.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – FOUR PANELS**\nSingle row.\n\n**Panel One**\nA police line encircles the hospital. We’re behind the line. Near the foreground, a SWAT team in a van is gearing up.\n\n1. TORQUE: (Elec) (From the roof) Listen carefully, boyos, because this is *not* your parents’ hostage situation.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Torque. He’s on the roof and a henchman is holding up a megaphone for him.\n\n1. TORQUE: (Elec) We’ve turned this place of healin’ into a world of hurt. Every hour, we release one hostage. If’n you let us leave, we’ll kill ‘em all just to spite you.\n\n**Panel Three**\nWide shot from the side so we can see Torque’s backwards head in profile.\n\n1. TORQUE: (Elec) Backwards, ain’t it? Anyway, if you attack, we *also* kill ‘em all. The only way they survive is you waitin’ for us to be done with ‘em.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot on a group of police across from the front door. CHIEF REDHORN is in front. AMY ROHRBACH is visible further back.\n\n1. OFFICER 1: That’s easy, right? Just wait him out and everyone’s safe!\n\n2. AMY: At one an hour? We could be here for *weeks!*\n\n3. REDHORN: He’s lying. Tell the team to move in.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – FOUR PANELS**\nDiagonal stack from top left to bottom right.\n\n**Panel One**\nFive SWAT officers are stacked up outside the same emergency exit from before.\n\n1. SWAT TEAM LEADER: Three. Two…\n\n**Panel Two**\nInside. They burst through the door with a battering ram, emerging into a hallway.\n\n1. CAPTION: “… One!”\n\n2. SFX: ***BAM!!!***\n\n**Panel Three**\nReverse the shot. The hall is lined with henchmen toting assault rifles. They open fire.\n\n1. SFX: BUDDA BUDDA *BAM!*\n\n**Panel Four**\nTwo of the SWAT officers are dragging a third back out through the door, one yelling into a radio. A fourth is visible getting shot as he fires futilely back at the henchmen.\n\n1. SFX: RATTATTAT!\n\n2. SWAT OFFICER: Three officers down! It was a trap!\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nBack to Torque.\n\n1. TORQUE: (Elec) That was *stupid,* Delmore. *Really* stupid.\n\n**Panel Two**\nTorque turns so his body faces the edge of the roof and extends his arms.\n\n1. TORQUE: (Elec) But seein’ as we’re old pals, and I already *knew* you were plenty stupid, Chief, what say I cut you a little slack?\n\n**Panel Three**\nTorque reaches back to scratch his chin.\n\n1. TORQUE: (Elec) Let’s just kill *five* hostages instead of *all* of ‘em.\n\n**Panel Four**\nTwo officers restrain Redhorn from rushing the front door himself.\n\n1. REDHORN: You crazy &@$+@%#!\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Amy, looking up at the hospital in concern.\n\n1. AMY: Where the hell is *Grayson,* anyway?\n\n**Panel Six**\nWe follow her gaze up at the plume of smoke that’s still rising from the landing pad.\n\n1. AMY: At this point, I wouldn’t even mind seeing that vigilante. Whatsisname.\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nNightwing is fighting some of the smuggler gang from the docks. The quaint architecture tells us that we’re in Baily Church. Of the three thugs he’s battling, one is already unconscious and he’s in the process of kicking another in the head. The third is swinging with a knife at nothing much, though Nightwing certainly *might’ve* been there a second or two ago.\n\n1. CAPTION: “Nightmonkey or whatever.”\n\n2. NIGHTWING: Didn’t your mother ever tell you it’s *dangerous* to play with knives?\n\n3. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Can’t *believe* I let Deathstroke get away.\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe knife-wielding thug lunges at Nightwing, who’s dodging out of the way and grabbing his knife arm.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) All right. Fine. I can *believe* it.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: Someone should take that away from you.\n\n**Panel Three**\nNightwing squeezes the arm and the thug drops his knife, yelling in pain.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I’m just *mad* about it.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Nightwing.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: You guys are a little far from your turf. If you don’t want me to squeeze *harder,* maybe you’ll let me in on why.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on the thug.\n\n1. THUG: We’re chasing that *other* crazy ninja guy, man! He was snooping around!\n\n2. NIGHTWING: *Elaborate.*\n\n3. THUG: In this whole yellow and orange get-up, man! He-\n\n**Panel Six**\nTighter closeup on the thug. He looks surprised.\n\n1. THUG: (SFX) Urk\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – SPLASH**\nPull out. The thug has a throwing star embedded in his throat. Nightwing is turning to face SHRIKE, who’s standing on top of a car and drawing his swords.\n\n1. SHRIKE: Now, is that an entrance, or is *that* an *entrance?*\n\n2. NIGHTWING: *Shrike!*\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nVertical stack\n\n**Panel One**\nShrike lunges towards Nightwing with a flying kick. Nightwing is deflecting it.\n\n1. SHRIKE: That’s my name. Don’t wear it out!\n\n2. NIGHTWING: What, like your *banter?*\n\n**Panel Two**\nShrike has landed on his feet and swings backwards with a sword, forcing Nightwing to pull a punch he was trying to land.\n\n1. SHRIKE: That was just *rude,* Chester.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Holy mistaken identity, he *still* hasn’t figured out that was a fake name?\n\n**Panel Three**\nNightwing deploys one of his escrima sticks, striking Shrike in the wrist. Shrike is dropping one of his swords.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) This guy has a stupid grudge against me going back to when I was Robin. He didn’t know my name at the time, and Oracle fed him a fake one when he tried to figure it out more recently. Was a *close* call.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: Knowing that one’s sure been a big help, hasn’t it, Boone?\n\n**Panel Four**\nShrike draws one of his tonfas, swinging it out and snapping Nightwing’s escrima stick in half.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I *knew* there was a drawback to the telescoping design.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShrike brings his sword down and Nightwing blocks with his remaining stick, but he’s being forced to his knees.\n\n1. SHRIKE: *Someone’s* going to appreciate it soon.\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nThree rows of one and one row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nPull in closer on Shrike grinning down at Nightwing.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: What’s (SFX: uhn) *that* supposed to mean?\n\n2. SHRIKE: Wouldn’t *you* like to-\n\n**Panel Two**\nNightwing activates the taser in his remaining escrima stick, shocking Shrike.\n\n1. SHRIKE: NO!\n\n2. SFX: BZZZZT!\n\n**Panel Three**\nNightwing grabs Shrike’s head and slams it down onto his knee.\n\n**Panel Four**\nNightwing is kneeling over the unconscious Shrike, pulling a slip of paper out of a pouch on his suit.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on the paper. It’s folded in half so we can’t see the address.\n\n1. PAPER: You are cordially invited by KONING INDUSTRIES to BID for the true secret IDENTITY of NIGHTWING. Simply be present at the following address:\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot past Shrike’s unconscious body up at Nightwing, who’s scratching his chin.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: Hm…\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – THREE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nIt’s darker now. Numerous cars are parked along the street outside an old concert hall.\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe’re looking down at the entrance from the roof of the building opposite. In the foreground is, apparently, Shrike.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on “Shrike.”\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) For two guys with similar builds, Shrike’s outfit does *not* fit me very well.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Figure he planned to put in a token bid and then sell out “Chester Honeywell” to the losing parties.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nNightwing drops down to street level.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHe ascends the steps.\n\n**Panel Three**\nA man in a black suit and sunglasses is fastening a small metal wristband onto Nightwing.\n\n1. MAN IN SUIT: Gotta check you in, Shrike.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: Uh, right.\n\n**Panel Four**\nNightwing enters the hall.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Cap) OK, nobody’s shooting at me yet. That’s a good sign. I think.\n\n**Panel Five**\nPull in closer on Nightwing’s surprised expression.\n\n1. NIGHTWING: (Whispering) Holy rogues gallery!\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on a pair of men, apparently identical twins. One wears a plaid suit and the other an orange one.\n\n1. PLAID TWIN: (Whispering) What did Mr. Dent say our budget was again?\n\n2. ORANGE TWIN: (Whispering) Twenty-two million, you maroon.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on the MAD HATTER.\n\n1. MAD HATTER: (Singing) (Whispering) One pill makes you larger… and one pill makes you small…\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on DOCTOR LIGHT.\n\n1. DOCTOR LIGHT: (Whispering) Humiliate *me,* will he?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on KEMPER VON CART. He’s not saying anything, just glowering.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on BLOCKBUSTER.\n\n1. BLOCKBUSTER: Perhaps you all ought to save yourselves some time and leave *now.*\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Archangel.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: Maybe *I* just want to make *you* pay as much as possible.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) I know *most* of these guys, but who’s *she?*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nBlockbuster rises to his feet.\n\n1. BLOCKBUSTER: I see no need to *antagonize* me… Archangel, is it?\n\n2. BLOCKBUSTER: I have more than sufficient reason to kill you where you stand as it is.\n\n**Panel Two**\nArchangel is also standing.\n\n1. ARCHANGEL: I do so *dearly* wish you’d try.\n\n**Panel Three**\nWide shot. The two are starting towards each other from opposite ends of the seats. STALLION has a hand on Blockbuster’s arm in a feeble attempt to hold him back while an Angel of Death has an arm extended in front of Archangel.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) ENOUGH!\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from the side. A person in silhouette addresses the crowd.\n\n1. SILHOUETTED PERSON: Anyone disrupting the bargaining process *will* be ejected from the proceedings.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBack to Nightwing. He has one brow arched curiously.\n\n1. SILHOUETTED PERSON: (Off-panel) Our first and last item tonight is the true identity of the vigilante known as Nightwing.\n\n2. NIGHTWING: (Cap) Hey, wait a second.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – SPLASH**\nLow angle back on the stage. There is a projection of a a large graphic of Nightwing’s symbol with a question mark superimposed over it, and one of a box saying “STARTING BID - $10,000,000.00.” The silhouetted presenter is a woman in a black-and-orange spider-themed costume, who readers may identify as the TARANTULA.\n\n1.

BABS: (Cap) I would say I practically grew up in this place, but now that I think about it, I was most of the way through high school before I ever saw Gotham.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot of the roof. The BAT-SIGNAL is visible, but not lit.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) I’ve been here a lot, though. Dad is the Commissioner, his wife runs the Major Crimes division, and I even worked in Dispatch for a year or so. That’s a long story.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe same angle, sans fog and with a hazy filter indicating a flashback.

The monitors display, from left to right and top to bottom:\n\n* Batman inside the BATMOBILE\n* Oracle’s symbol of a pointy, stylized face\n* A screen showing funds transferring from a bank account in the name of ROLAND DESMOND to one in the name of CASSANDRA DELPHI\n* BLACK CANARY’s face\n* A red screen blocked by Oracle’s head, and\n* A security feed of the JOKER sitting straitjacketed in a padded cell.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) After my injury, I couldn’t very well stay in the face-kicking game. I don’t quit *quite* that easily, so I created *Oracle.* She’s a strategist/researcher/coordinator/dispatcher/spymaster/hacker, not to mention general tech support for the world’s more technologically illiterate heroes. In short, the first work-from-home superhero.\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) Do I miss Batgirl? Sure. But what I’m doing now is just so much more *interesting.*\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe filter is gone. Angle from beside the door as Babs enters, waving cheerily to a police officer at a metal detector.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) I’m getting off-track, aren’t I? If this turns into one of Dick’s rambling tangential soliloquies, throw something at me.\n\n**PAGE THREE – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nTwo-shot. Babs and Jim are hugging in the middle of the station. She’s kissing him on the cheek.\n\n1. JIM: There’s my baby girl.\n\n2. BABS: “Baby?”\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe two proceed down a hallway.\n\n1. JIM: No problem with “girl?”\n\n2. BABS: Let’s grow up one ste- one move at a time.\n\n3. BABS: (Cap) And I *started* calling myself “Batgirl” when I was well into my twenties, so I have no room to complain. That said, I still estimate a statistically significant 15% chance that he doesn’t know that.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Jim, looking a little concerned.\n\n1. JIM: Are you OK?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Babs. More than anything, she looks very tired.\n\n1. BABS: I’m… just working too hard.\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) I *will* tell him what’s really bothering me.\n\n**Panel Five**\nTwo-shot of the Gordons in an elevator as the doors begin to close.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Some other time.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of one, a row of three, a row of two, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nInside the elevator. Jim is scratching his mustache.\n\n1. JIM: So what *have* you been working on?\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) Tracing around twenty highly dangerous Arkham escapees.*\n\n3. BABS: (Cap) Treating my boyfriend for a gunshot wound.**\n\n4. BABS: (Cap) Sending my best friend into mortal danger to crack an international crime cartel.***\n\n5. BABS: … Programming stuff.\n\n6. BABS: (Cap) I’m *lying* a lot lately. *Never* a good sign.\n\n7. CAPTION: *DCW: Alpha oneshot. **Nightwing #1. ***As we’ll see in more detail next issue. – ContinuityJamags\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from behind as they leave the elevator.\n\n1. BABS: So, uh, what have *you* been working on?\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) *Smooth.*\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Jim.\n\n1. JIM: Barbara, how much do you know about this Gothcorp business*?\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) More than I want to and far less than I need to.\n\n3. CAPTION: *As detailed in Batman #1. – HavingTooMuchFunWithSharedUniversesJamags\n\n**Panel Four**\nThey’ve arrived at a door with the words “COMMISSIONER JAMES GORDON” written on a frosted glass window.\n\n1. BABS: This “Panacea” thing is supposed to be some kind of miracle cure, right?\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from the other side of the door. Jim is circling around to his desk and Babs is rolling up to it. There are several photographs set up on the desk, a few featuring Babs at various ages and a couple of an older blonde woman – SARAH ESSEN.\n\n1. JIM: Well, yes, it’s…\n\n2. BABS: No need to walk on eggshells, Dad. I know a con when I see one. Exploiting everyone’s hopes like this is just… low.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Jim.\n\n1. JIM: But what if it isn’t a con?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nCloseup on Babs. She’s holding one of the pictures of Sarah. There’s a very faint green haze behind her.\n\n1. BABS: Then it’ll be a pleasant surprise, just like all the flying livestock.  By the way, is Sarah in?\n\n2. JIM: (Off-panel) It’s her day of-\n\n3. SFX: Knock knock knock!\n\n4. JIM: (Off-panel) I’ll get that.\n\n5. BABS: *I* wasn’t getting up.\n\n6. BABS: (Cap) Ugh, I *know* he hates it when I make those j-\n\n**PAGE FIVE – SPLASH**\nJim has opened the office door. THE JOKER is stepping through, shooting him in the chest with a large revolver. Babs has twisted around, shocked. Her chair is tipping over away from the Joker.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) -okes?\n\n2. SFX: *BLAM!*\n\n3. BABS: ***DAD!!!***\n\n4. JOKER: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\n**PAGE SIX – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, a row of three, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle. Babs is crawling backwards away from a looming Joker.\n\n1. JOKER: Hee.\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) No. No. No. This can’t-\n\n3. BABS: (Cap) *-Can’t* be happening. Joker still in Arkham. Impersonator? Hallucination?\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe Joker begins to fade into the now-much-denser green mist.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Fear Gas?\n\n**Panel Three**\nExtreme closeup on Babs. She looks *mad.*\n\n1. BABS: *Crane.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nHigh angle from the desk. Babs is dragging herself back towards Jim. Jim is crumpled against the wall but still alive, eyes wide with panic.\n\n1. JIM: No! You get away from her!\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) He’s probably seeing about the same thing I just saw, only…\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Babs, crawling towards the reader. She’s cringing.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) … Closer to how it *really* happened*.\n\n2. CAPTION: * In the infamous *Batman: The Killing Joke* graphic novel, of course. – OneBadDayJamags\n\n**Panel Six**\nBabs is holding onto Jim’s arm. He’s reaching into his jacket.\n\n1. BABS: It’s OK, Dad. You’re all right. I’m here. *Talk* to me.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nJim pulls a HANDGUN out of his jacket.\n\n1. JIM: I said *get away!*\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nTwo-shot. Babs has wrestled the gun away from Jim.\n\n1. BABS: This, while you’re tripping out on spooky juice? Not happening.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBabs places the gun in a desk drawer.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Where’d I leave my *chair*, n-\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe Joker is standing next to a dining room chair, holding a coil of rope in one hand and a camera in another. The chair is not remarkable in itself, but nice enough to look very out-of-place in the police station. It’s also stained with blood.\n\n1. JOKER: Your *throne,* my Lady?\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) Oh, God. Oh *God.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nBabs is back in her wheelchair, the dining chair gone. The Joker is still present, leaning in uncomfortably close.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Just my chair. Just me, my chair, and a certain Scarecrow who’d know not to mess with me if he only had a *brain.*\n\n2. JOKER: Hey, that wasn’t half-bad, Toots. Ever consider going into comedy?\n\n3. BABS: (Cap) Just what I need. A Joker who can hear my thoughts.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBabs has moved over to the door and is yanking it open, directly into where the Joker’s face would be if he were real. Instead, the door is only stirring up green mist.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Babs with a surprised expression.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – EIGHT PANELS**\nThe panels are roughly triangular, stacked one on top of the other with a wide end on one side and coming to a point on the other. The borders of Panels One, Two, Four, and Five are wobbly and hazily fade into the edge of the panel, while the other panels’ borders are crisp and straight.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over Babs’ shoulder. The hall outside is not the austere police station hall seen earlier, but a rotting wooden walkway painted in gaudy shades of purple, green, and yellow. Funhouse mirrors hang unevenly along the walls. In the one across from the door, Babs is reflected as a limp wooden puppet in a stroller with an oversized smile painted roughly across its face. Aside from the puppet, the hall is reflected in the mirrors as it actually looks, making both the real Babs and her twisted reflection look out-of-place. The Joker is leaning in from the other side of the panel from Babs.\n\n1. JOKER: I thought it wasn’t a bad likeness.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Babs, teeth gritted and rubbing her forehead.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Stop letting it *distract* you. Where is this stuff coming from?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on a wall vent with green smoke pouring out of it.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Bingo. Crane’s working from ventilation control.\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) Problem is, the City of Gotham is still stuck in the previous millennium and doesn’t keep municipal schematics in digital form. Haven’t had an excuse to get my hands on the hard copy since the most recent renovations, so I don’t know where that is.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBabs is rolling down the hallway. Ahead, at a corner, a woman is tied to the wall by the arms. She has dark hair, only just long enough to hang down over her face. Her throat and abdomen are crisscrossed by scars. The pose should call to mind *Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters*. The Joker is standing next to her.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) I *do* know where the *records room* is. I can pull the building schematics from there and-\n\n2. JOKER: Lookie here! Your friend’s not looking too good, is she?\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup. The Joker pulls the woman’s head up by the hair. Two more scars have been carved into her cheeks in a twisted approximation of a smile.\n\n1. JOKER: Hope you don’t mind that I gave her a makeover.\n\n2. JOKER: I mean, *she* seems happy about it.\n\n3. BABS: Dinah…?\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Babs’ hand touching the wall behind the woman as she dissolves into more smoke.\n\n1. BABS: No. Nobody.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nBabs begins to open a door.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nShot over a TERRIFIED OFFICER’S shoulder as he points his gun at the door. Babs is ducking back away from the opening. Several more officers have taken cover behind desks around the room, which, other than the furniture, looks like a run-down merry-go-round.\n\n1. TERRIFIED OFFICER: All of you, *get back!* I know what you *really* are!\n\n**PAGE NINE – SIX PANELS**\nA row of three, a row of one, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nExtreme closeup on Babs’ hand. A small pole is sliding out of her sleeve and into her hand.\n\n**Panel Two**\nPull out as she rolls into the doorway.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) I don’t know if I can knock him out before he shoots somebody else. Better get his attention first.\n\n2. BABS: Excuse me, Officer?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Terrified Officer turning to face her, pointing the gun.\n\n1. TERRIFIED OFFICER: Get back, demon!\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle. Terrified Officer is being struck in the face by a spinning escrima stick.\n\n1. SFX: CLUNK!\n\n**Panel Five**\nFull shot of Babs moving through the doorway. The Joker is leaning against the frame behind her.\n\n1. BABS: OK then. Anyone *else* think I’m a demon?\n\n2. JOKER: Aw, li’l old *you?* Who’d be afraid of a harmless little cr-\n\n3. BABS: (Covering part of the Joker’s speech bubble) ***Shut. Up.***\n\n**Panel Six**\nBabs has pulled up to the elevators on the other side of the room. She’s hitting the “DOWN” button. The Joker is leaning against the doors, waving his hands dramatically.\n\n1. JOKER: Now, a guy like *me* could get *used* to ruling over the pits of He-\n\n**PAGE TEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of one, two rows of two, and a row of one. Panel Six takes up about half the page.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe elevator door slides open. The Joker is tumbling through it even as he dissolves into a cloud of gas again.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Now *that’s* funny.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Babs, inside the elevator, one eyebrow raised.\n\n1. SFX: Tink!\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) What now?\n\n**Panel Three**\nHigh angle. She’s leaning down, and we can see a silver ring lying on the floor.\n\n1. BABS: What?\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) I thought you’d want that back.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBabs looks up to see DICK GRAYSON, his arms folded.\n\n1. DICK: Just kidding. Like there’d be a ring to begin with. I can’t *wait* for you to sort out your *issues* anymore.\n\n**Panel Five**\nJASON BARD has materialized next to Dick, patting him on the shoulder.\n\n1. JASON: Nice move, Dick. Get out while you still have a *life* ahead of you.\n\n2. DICK: And *God forbid* we ever *actually-*\n\n**Panel Six**\nBabs is firing a gun, the same one Jim pulled before. She’s hit both Dick and Jason in the heart.\n\n1. SFX: BLAM! BLAM!\n\n2. DICK: (Shakily) Typical, really…\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of one and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle. Babs is looking down at the gun in her hand in shock.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) But… I put it…\n\n**Panel Two**\nShe shakes her hand and the gun dissolves into smoke. The Joker is standing next to her again in the background, leering over her shoulder at the gun.\n\n1. BABS: … Away?\n\n2. JOKER: Hoo hoo! Fakeout! I prefer a little flag that says “BANG!” myself, but hey, beggars can’t be choosers.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot of an elevator door.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe door slides open and Babs rolls out.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Babs, gasping. Massive flames are reflected in her glasses.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – THREE PANELS**\nThe panels are stacked vertically and of roughly equal size.\n\n**Panel One**\nPOV shot. The doors have opened onto a ship’s deck. The ship is on fire and listing heavily. The flames, placed where the real hallway’s walls should be, climb high into the air, blacking out the sky with smoke. We see faint outlines of human bodies in various anguished poses deep in the flames. Directly ahead, a woman in a red cape is on her knees, facing away. A very small body is in her lap. We can’t see the face or hands, but the singed clothes and wisps of smoke don’t bode well for the child’s health.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) No.\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe’re still in Babs’ POV. She’s approached the kneeling woman. The woman, now clearly POWER GIRL, is looking over her shoulder angrily. Babs is reaching out towards her, apparently intending to comfort her.\n\n1. POWER GIRL: This * is all *your* fault, Oracle.\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) This has gone on long enough. Time to get a grip.\n\n3. CAPTION: * “This” being detailed in 2002’s Birds of Prey #42. – BirdsOfPreyObsessedJamags.\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull out to the side. Babs has grabbed Power Girl by the shoulders and is yelling back.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Literally.\n\n2. BABS: Grow *up,* Karen!\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of one, a row of three, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup of Babs, pointing angrily.\n\n1. BABS: I’ve tried and tried and *tried* to extend every *possible* olive branch, but *no.* You’ve been holding this over me for *years,* and we *both* know there’s ***not a damned thing either of us could’ve done!***\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) And does that make you feel better?\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe’re back in the dilapidated funhouse. This hall is even worse lit than the one upstairs, the gaudy patterns still present but scratched and faded. Babs is turning to face a smirking Batgirl, who is leaning against the wall.\n\n1. BATGIRL: Or is that *exactly* what you’re afraid of? That you. Can’t. Do. Anything.\n\n2. BABS: Is *this* what we’re doing right now? You’d think the armchair psychoanalysis would be *my* job.\n\n3. BATGIRL: Hey, that wasn’t half-bad, Toots. Ever consider going into comedy? Never mind, you wouldn’t be any good at *standup.*\n\n4. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) She’s a real pain, ain’t she?\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe Joker appears again, wrapping one arm around Batgirl’s shoulders and gesturing at Babs with a gun in the other hand. Batgirl suddenly looks very uncomfortable.\n\n1. JOKER: Really, you should be *glad* I shot her. You. Me? No, that’s not right. *Whoever’s* head I’m a figment of.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBabs is angrily pulling open a door that has “RECORDS” stenciled on it. Her two hallucinatory friends are following her.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) *Having* hallucinations is one thing, but let’s maybe stop *talking* to them.\n\n2. JOKER: C’mon, baby, don’t go away mad!\n\n3. JOKER: (SFX) HAHAHAHA!\n\n4. BATGIRL: It’s not *my* fault you’ve become such a basket case.\n\n**Panel Five**\nView from inside a file drawer Babs is digging through. Batgirl is looking over her shoulder.\n\n1. BATGIRL: What are you even trying to *prove* down here? How many people are dying because you’re too proud to just go switch on the Bat-Signal?\n\n2. BABS: We both know Bru- Batman’s response time isn’t *that* good. I can head this thing off *now.*\n\n3. BATGIRL: Or as soon as you finish crawling up the stairs, anyway. Maybe I’ll catch a *nap* in the meantime.\n\n4. BABS: *Please* do.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe same angle, but our view outside the drawer is obscured by a file Babs is pulling out.\n\n1. BABS: *There* it is.\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, a row of two, and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh angle over a desk. Babs has laid out a blueprint. The Joker is sitting on the desk, kicking his feet excitedly.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Ventilation is controlled from a utility room on the top floor. Of *course* it is.\n\n2. JOKER: Say, you see the kitchen anywhere on there? I’m famished.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBabs is outside by the elevators, hitting the button. Batgirl is ducking into the stairwell in the background.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Nothing. He must’ve shut them down.\n\n2. BATGIRL: Hey, Wheels: I *tooooooold* you so!\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from the top of a flight of stairs. Babs has left her chair behind at the bottom and is dragging herself up by her hands. The panel is framed by Batgirl’s arched leg in the foreground. Think *The Graduate*.\n\n1. BABS: What are you, (SFX: Ughn) four?\n\n2. BATGIRL: I’m *hot* is what I am. Young. Free. *Batgirl.*\n\n3. BABS: Not. (SFX: Uff) Anymore.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBabs’ POV again. Batgirl has stood up and started laughing. In front of her at the top of the stairs is… also BATGIRL. Specifically, CASSANDRA CAIN, on her knees and staring numbly at her blood-soaked hands.\n\n1. BATGIRL: Oh, and *this* is your substitute? What a pair *you* two make.\n\n2. BABS: (Off-panel) Leave. Cass. *Alone.*\n\n3. BATGIRL: Barbara “Legs” Gordon and her pet killing machine! The Brave and the Bold can make way for the Broken and the *Brainless!*\n\n**Panel Five**\nBabs is leaning against the handrail at the top of the flight, sweating. Both Batgirls are crouching next to her. The original is sneering, and Cass is still staring blankly.\n\n1. BABS: (SFX) Huff. Huff.\n\n2. BATGIRL: This is one attack dog that needs to go back to the shelter before it *bites* somebody.\n\n3. BABS: (Weakly) Just… just leave her alone.\n\n4. CASS: She’s… right. *Never* be human. Why won’t you… let me?\n\n5. BABS: I’m… I’m sorry.\n\n6. BABS: (Cap) Getting into arguments with my own brain again.\n\n7. BABS: (Cap) One flight down, seven to go. No problem.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBabs’ hand is planted on the top of another flight, next to a heavy black boot.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) Barbara!\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nLow angle. Babs is looking up at the looming figure of Batman.\n\n1. BATMAN: What are you doing here? Are you hurt?\n\n2. BABS: Uh… no more than usual.\n\n3. BATMAN: Someone turned on the Signal. I took down Crane and shut off the gas. Everything’s alright now.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Babs, looking relieved.\n\n1. BABS: I… Thank you, Bruce.\n\n2. BATMAN: (Off-panel) But, Barbara…\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Batman, saddened.\n\n1. BATMAN: Your father… didn’t make it.\n\n2. BABS: (Off-panel) What?\n\n3. BATMAN: Maybe if someone had called me sooner…\n\n**Panel Four**\nPull out to a wide shot. Babs is curling into the fetal position on the stairs. Batman remains impassive.\n\n1. BABS: How did this happen…?\n\n2. BATMAN: You should go home. Take some time to mourn. You’re not needed here anymore.\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nExtreme closeup on Batman, angrier.\n\n1. BATMAN: In fact, you were *never* needed. Never *wanted.* My city. My mission. My *symbol.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Babs, coughing amid heavy green mist.\n\n1. BABS: (SFX: Caff) Another *cheap* shot, Crane.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBabs is propping herself against the wall next to a door, and pushing the handle out away from her to get it open.\n\n1. SFX: (By the handle) Clack!\n\n2. SFX: (By the hinges) Creak!\n\n**Panel Four**\nDown another hallway (this one without the funhouse-like fear gas distortions that have followed Babs so far), the SCARECROW, armed with a scythe and a glove that looks like Freddy Krueger’s, but with syringes instead of knives, is turning towards sounds coming from around a corner.\n\n1. SFX: (Smaller and quieter, by the corner) Clack! Creak!\n\n2. SCARECROW: Eh?\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe Scarecrow rounds the corner, brandishing his weapons. We still see the hall as it actually is.\n\n1. SCARECROW: ***Boo!***\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nWider shot of the Scarecrow. The hallway, still undistorted, is empty. The Joker is standing in the middle, frantically pointing upwards.\n\n1. SCARECROW: I could’ve sworn I heard something…\n\n2. JOKER: Jonathan! Johnny! Up there, Johnny! Check the *drop ceiling,* you idiot!\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same angle, back in the funhouse. The Scarecrow is stalking off around the corner and Babs is hanging down from the ceiling. Batgirl is on the ground, leaning up close to Babs’ face.\n\n1. BATGIRL: *Nice* pull-up, girl. Got to work those arms; they’re *all* you’ve got!\n\n**Panel Three**\nBabs is dragging herself along the floor again, in the opposite direction of where Crane went. In the background, we can see the Joker’s legs as he walks along behind her.\n\n1. JOKER: Yoo hoo! Johnny! Over *heeeeeeeere!*\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) I… I *can’t* do this.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot past Babs’ shoulder, up at a door marked “ARMORY.”\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Not without a few *tools,* that is.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBabs has gotten the armory door open. Inside, we can see shelves of various weapons, body armor, and other police equipment.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Almost there. Now, where do they store the-\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) You *coward.*\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of one, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nIn the foreground, Babs is sitting next to a shelf, reaching for something on it. In the background is the HUNTRESS, her cape folded around her.\n\n1. HUNTRESS: What, are you *hiding* in here?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Huntress. She looks furious.\n\n1. HUNTRESS: You didn’t think you’d get through today without seeing *me,* did you?\n\n**Panel Three**\nWider shot. Huntress is throwing her cape open to reveal a young BOY, no older than twelve, standing next to her. He’s holding a stuffed doll that looks like Batgirl. The boy is sobbing and the doll has a painted-on grin.\n\n1. HUNTRESS: Without seeing *him?*\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Babs, still reaching into the shelf. She looks heartbroken.\n\n1. BABS: Helena…\n\n**Panel Five**\nExtreme closeup. Babs is pulling on a GAS MASK. We can see her eyes faintly through the mask’s lenses, and her expression has hardened.\n\n1. BABS: ***Not. Now.***\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nBabs is climbing onto a shelf of tear gas grenades next to the door.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) Crane uses his gas to *break* people. Make them doubt themselves.\n\n**Panel Two**\nHigh angle. Babs throws some of the shelf’s contents onto the floor.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) But all it’s done for *me*…\n\n2. SFX: CLATTER!\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe same angle. The Scarecrow leans in through the door curiously.\n\n1. BABS: (Cap) … Is remind me of all the people I’ll *disappoint*…\n\n2. SCARECROW: Who…?\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle. Babs is flinging herself from her perch, striking Scarecrow directly across the face and sending him sprawling.\n\n1. SCARECROW: ACK!\n\n2. BABS: (Cap) … If I don’t *take him down!*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of two near the top. Panel Three takes up the bulk of the page. Inset on the right of it is a circle containing a four-panel grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Jim, looking relieved. He’s emerging from the stairwell.\n\n1. JIM: Barbara!\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Babs. She’s leaning against the wall, with a faint, exhausted smile.\n\n1. BABS: Hi, Dad.\n\n**Panel Three**\nJim is hugging Babs. Tightly.\n\n1. JIM: Where *were* you?\n\n2. BABS: I, uh, got this stupid idea I’d go light the Bat-Signal. I guess I didn’t make it.\n\n3. JIM: Are… are you all right?\n\n4. BABS: Yeah, Dad…\n\n**Panel Four**\nEstablishing shot of the Clocktower.\n\n1. CAPTION: Later.\n\n**Panel Five**\nInterior shot. We see the same clock face from inside, getting an overall view of Babs’ apartment.\n\n**Panel Six**\nWe see Babs’ bedroom. She’s sitting on her bed, hugging her knees to her chest and wearing a mask that resembles the Oracle symbol.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nExtreme closeup on the mask’s eyehole. We can see faintly through the lens that Babs’ actual eye is still wide with terror.\n\n1. BABS: (Stretching over from Panel Three) “… Everything’s just fine.”\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of one and two rows of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe see a low angle of Batman, crouching on a grotesque, the wind causing his cape to billow over his shoulder.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) Thank you for meeting with me on short notice.\n\n**Panel Two**\nPull up to look over Batman’s shoulder as he turns to face DETECTIVE JOHN JONES, a muscular middle-aged man in a trench coat.\n\n1. BATMAN: J’onn.\n\n2. JOHN: Is this location secure?\n\n3. BATMAN: How secure do you *need* it to be?\n\n4. JOHN: Perhaps we should avoid real names. Just to be safe.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Batman, stepping back onto the roof. He’s frowning.\n\n1. BATMAN: I’ve never known you to be *this* paranoid.\n\n2. JOHN: (Off-panel) I have a question that you probably won’t answer.\n\n**Panel Four**\nA tighter closeup on John.\n\n1. JOHN: Batman, who is Oracle?\n\n**Panel Five**\nPull back out to a high, wide shot of the roof. Batman has turned away slightly and folded his arms.\n\n1. BATMAN: You’re right. I won’t.\n\n2. JOHN: Then tell me this: How much do you *trust* her?\n\n**Panel Six**\nWe see over John’s shoulder. Batman is turning back to John and gesturing at him, clearly agitated.\n\n1. BATMAN: With my *life*, John. With my *kids’* lives. You *know* I don’t say that lightly.\n\n2. JOHN: I hope so, because exactly that may be at stake.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nTwo-shot. Batman is pointing a finger angrily at John’s chest.\n\n1. BATMAN: Stop speaking in *riddles*, John. *What are you saying?*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on John, looking very grim.\n\n1. JOHN: I have reason to believe that the Omega File has been stolen.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Batman, with a shocked expression on his face.\n\n1. BATMAN: My God… Who would be able to-\n\n**Panel Three**\nJohn has stepped out to the edge of the roof. Batman is folding his arms in the background.\n\n1. JOHN: Without leaving a trace? Only two people had access, and *I’m* one of them.\n\n2. BATMAN: You assume I can trust *you*.\n\n3. JOHN: No, I don’t. But *I* trust *myself.* Unless you tell me who Oracle is, you’re the *only* one in a position to investigate *her.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Batman again.\n\n1. BATMAN: You *could* read my mind.\n\n2. JOHN: (Off-panel) You *know* I don’t do that without permission. Not unless I have to.\n\n3. BATMAN: Fine. I’ll… look into it. But I’ll be watching *you*, too.\n\n4. JOHN: (Off-panel) *Will* you?\n\n**Panel Five**\nWide shot of the rooftop. John has disappeared.\n\n1.

It’s dark, but sunrise is beginning to bleed into the sky. The clock tells us that it’s 5:56 in the morning. BABS is a little hard to make out in detail at this distance, but we can see her on the roof, facing the sun.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Sunrise in Gotham. That probably *symbolizes* something.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) I mean *other* than extreme insomnia.\n\n3. TITLE: THE OMEGA FILE PART II – GOOD COP, BAT COP\n\n**PAGE TWO – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nFull shot of Babs. She’s wrapped in a heavy coat, holding a steaming mug in her hand, and looks *exhausted.*\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Up all night shaking off the effects of prolonged Fear Gas exposure.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Hallucinations wore off but I’m still scared $#!%less of… nothing in particular.\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup. Close enough to see the sun rising above the city skyline reflected in her glasses.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) … Yeah, *definitely* just the gas.\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull out to a regular closeup. We’re inside the elevator, which Babs is entering.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) I couldn’t sleep.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Nothing a fresh dose of caffeine and the biggest plate of scrambled eggs I’ve ever made won’t alleviate.\n\n**Panel Four**\nWe cut to the kitchen table. As promised, the eggs are prodigious.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) OK, agenda time.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Item One: Keep working this Arkham breakout. We’ve still got Fries, Nygma, and Isley on the loose at the *very* least, plus a few smaller names like Wesker, Whitman, and *Maxie Zeus* of all people. How haven’t we found *him* yet?\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) I’ll try getting in touch with Jeremiah Arkham. When he isn’t helpful, I’ll see if the Asylum’s system has some trace of how these guys got loose. Failing that, I’ll find someone with a cape to go snooping. Everybody’s *busy,* though. Hm, Spoiler? That might actually work.\n\n**PAGE THREE – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nPull in a little closer. Babs is chugging coffee.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Anyway, Item Two: Dinah’s probably landing in Nassau about now. Be a couple hours before she can reach the mission site, though, so that’s backburner material. She’ll call me when she needs me.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Item Three: The *situation* in Switzerland. Messing with that risks making things worse, but it calls for monitoring. Should get *Ted* on standby anyway.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBabs has paused, leaned back, and touched a hand to her head. Her eyes are shut tight but her posture is otherwise relaxed.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Item Four: Exposing this Panacea* scam. Mister Freeze is the big issue here, and I’m hitting a brick wall on *that* search.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Item Five: Dick needs to sort out all these new gangs that are hitting Blüdhaven**. Let him work it on his own for a while. I hate to leave him out in the cold, but he’s a big boy and I have too much else on my plate.\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) And I *don’t* mean the eggs.\n\n4. CAPTION: *Recent issues of Batman **Recent issues of Nightwing – MultiBatbookJamags\n\n**Panel Three**\nOur view pulls out and down a little so we can see that the plate is indeed empty.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Item Six: Figure out what’s setting off the motion sensors in the tunnels. *Probably* just an animal. I think. Worry about this later.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Item Seven…\n\n**Panel Four**\nWe’re now in a small private gym. Babs is using a pull-up bar.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) … Morning workout. Ordinarily, I’d write it off, but I’ve been letting it go too long as it is. First time in too long I’ve felt like I had the *energy.*\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Might as well get it in before I get cleaned up anyway.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nBabs is rolling into her bathroom.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) See, Dinah? I take care of myself *sometimes.* \n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Babs’ hand turning on the bathtub faucet.\n\n1. SFX: Ksssshhhh\n\n**Panel Three**\nOutside, we look at the empty central area from next to the clock face.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle. A shadow is cast over our view, however.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Babs drying her hair.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Well, that’s *one* item dealt with.\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot from behind Babs. She’s opening the bathroom door. Outside is BATMAN, looking particularly grim.\n\n1. BATMAN: We need to *talk.*\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) You’ve got to be #@%&ing kidding me.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a row of one.\n\n**Panel One**\nBabs is slamming the door shut and grabbing a bathrobe off of a hook on the door.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) *Seriously,* Bruce? *Now?*\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from outside, over Batman’s shoulder. Babs, now wearing the robe, is pulling the door open angrily.\n\n1. ORACLE: All right, what’s the crisis?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Or is this one of your dumb$#!% power plays? Can’t just break into my house and scare the #@%& out of me *any* time, have to do it when I’m-\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Batman.\n\n1. BATMAN: I spoke with the Martian Manhunter last night. He has reason to believe the *Omega File* has been stolen.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Babs. She looks surprised.\n\n1. ORACLE: What? That’s impossible, the *only* ones who should have access are-\n\n2. BATMAN: -The two of you. Exactly.\n\n**Panel Five**\nTwo-shot. They’re glaring at each other.\n\n1. ORACLE: So, what, then? He thinks this is *my* fault?\n\n2. BATMAN: *Is* it?\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) Head hurts. *Been* hurting? Should have *slept* last night.\n\n**PAGE SIX – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nBabs has moved closer to Batman, who remains impassive.\n\n1. ORACLE: How can you even *ask* that? I would *never* jeopardize-\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from Babs’ POV, looking up at Batman.\n\n1. BATMAN: This mystery only *has* two solutions, Oracle.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBabs is running her hands through her hair and looking down and the floor.\n\n1. ORACLE: I’m not a “solution,” Bruce, I’m your…\n\n**Panel Four**\nWide shot from behind. She’s looking up, but he’s gone.\n\n1. ORACLE: … friend?\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – THREE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Babs, looking down at her hands. We’re at a low angle, with her hands framing her face.\n\n1. ORACLE: I… I…\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same angle. She’s clenched her hands into fists.\n\n1. ORACLE: Item Eight: Punch Bruce.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShe’s moving over to her computers.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Item Nine: Figure out who *did* steal the File.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – FOUR PANELS**\nA row of one and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on a monitor. Oracle is looking at a grey-and-blue interface, which is displaying a list of names. The following names are visible, suggesting a longer alphabetical list:\nAdam, Nathaniel – CAPTAIN ATOM (Active)\nAllen, Bartholomew – FLASH (A)\nArthas – AQUAMAN (A)\nBaker, Buddy – ANIMAL MAN (Reserve)\nBatson, William – SHAZAM (A)\nBaz, Simon – GREEN LANTERN (A)\nBeecher, Karen – BUMBLEBEE (R)\nBertinelli, Helena – HUNTRESS (Probation)\nBlood, Jason (R)\nBloodwynd (Inactive)\nCain, Cassandra – BATGIRL (R)\nCarter, Michael – BOOSTER GOLD (P)\nCassidy, Daniel – BLUE DEVIL (A)\nChambers, Jonathan – JOHNNY QUICK (Inactive)\nClay, Lilith – OMEN (R)\nCorrigan, James – SPECTRE (R)\nCrandall, Maxwell – MAX MERCURY (I)\nCross, Pieter – DOCTOR MID-NITE (A)\nCruz, Jessica – GREEN LANTERN (A)\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Data hasn’t been *tampered* with. No out-of-place activity logged anywhere… *Weird.*\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) But hey, who set Captain Atom to Active*? He’s been Inactive for *years.*\n\n3. CAPTION: *Maybe you’ll find out *next* week in *his* title! – WeeklyJamags\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe same screen, reflected in one of the lenses of Oracle’s glasses.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) J’onn *must* be mistaken. Nothing’s out of order here.\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull out to a standard closeup. Oracle, her brow furrowed, has her temple resting against a fist and is adjusting her glasses.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) I’ll dig around for it online, maybe set up a scraper. But I need to get a hold of J’onn and figure out *why* he thinks it’s been taken.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShe’s sat up and is holding a cell phone.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) If there are no more *false alarms*, let’s work on Arkham.\n\n**PAGE NINE – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of two, a row of two, and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nInterior shot of another office. Those that read DCW: Alpha may recognize JEREMIAH ARKHAM’s office. He’s at his desk, looking haggard. There’s a phone next to him – a handset, because what are the chances Arkham Asylum *isn’t* twenty years out of date?\n\n1. SFX: (By the phone) Brrrring!\n\n**Panel Two**\nPull in closer as Arkham picks up the phone.\n\n1. ARKHAM: Arkham. Who is this?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Phone) Hello! Sally Harrison with the *Gazette*. Would you mind answering a few questions about the recent incident?\n\n**Panel Three**\nArkham is hanging up.\n\n1. ARKHAM: Yes.\n\n2. SFX: Click\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) And that was my very chipperest fake voice, too. *Nobody* yells at Sally.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack to Oracle, she’s taking her glasses off and pinching the bridge of her nose.\n\n1. ORACLE: Hookay, Jerry. I guess I’m doing this the hard way.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWe’re looking from on top of a bookshelf as Oracle approaches.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) I could crack Arkham’s computers, such as they are, in my sleep.\n\n**Panel Six**\nPOV shot of the mask in Oracle’s hands.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Using my special headset on this is probably overkill.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nWe’re back at about the same angle as Panel Five, but pulled in a bit tighter. Oracle is putting the mask on and it’s positioned about the same as it was in Panel Six relative to the borders.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Probably.\n\n**PAGE TEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe same as the last panel of the previous page, but the background is black.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Takes it a few seconds to boot up sometimes…\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe see a ghostly figure with a face like the mask, dressed in a white cloak and floating in the void. If you’ve read Oracle: Year One, it essentially looks like the figure from Babs’ dream in that story.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Here we go. Welcome to the *Oracle Mask.*\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Now, let it not be said that I am without humility: This technology is a little beyond me. Long story how I got my hands on it, but it’s kind of a VR device built with alien tech. I’d call it an “interface,” but there’s an AI component too. Here:\n\n3. ORACLE: Mask, bring up Arkham Asylum’s system.\n\n**Panel Three**\nA few planes of text appear around Oracle, mostly patient profiles. A few security camera feeds are visible in the background.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) I’m not sure *exactly* what it just did. Probably nothing complex. I could’ve gotten *access* to all these files myself. I just didn’t have to.\n\n2. ORACLE: Can you show me the feed from the security camera nearest Jonathan Crane’s cell at the time of the breakout?\n\n**Panel Four**\nWe’re looking at a fuzzy, lo-res security feed. Oracle is *in* the camera view, standing next to SCARECROW’s cell, albeit in full color and sharper definition.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Everything looks in order *now.*\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe same angle. The door has popped open and the lighting is slightly brighter.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) The fire alarms are tripped. We’re *getting* somewhere.\n\n**Panel Six**\nOracle is floating in front of a bunch of official-looking report forms.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Nothing in here about an actual fire, though.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Oracle.\n\n1. ORACLE: Who was logged into the computers when the alarms went off?\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe background turns red.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Figures they wouldn’t keep that data.\n\n2. ORACLE: Was anything sent over the Asylum’s *network* at that time?\n\n**Panel Three**\nAnother panel of text floats up in front of Oracle. The red is gone, and we can see the other stuff hovering in the background again.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Someone uploaded this directly the server. It’s plain text. Pure gibberish. Encrypted, maybe?\n\n2. ORACLE: Can you crack this, mask?\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot past Oracle’s shoulder. The text is in two paragraphs. One has been decrypted while the other is still rearranging itself.\n\n1. TEXT: **Superego:** When is a door not a door?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) A better example of what the Mask can do: Doing that the old-fashioned way would probably have taken several hours and at *least* three cups of coffee.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Oracle.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Next, an override code that switches on the fire alarms. Safety precaution in case the smoke detectors fail and no one triggers the alarms manually. Standard component of WayneTech alarm systems.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Item Ten: Punch Bruce *again.*\n\n**Panel Six**\nOracle is pulling away from the text.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) When the override code is entered, all of the cell doors pop open. They stop being doors and start being *ajar.*\n\n2. ORACLE: Show me Edward Nygma’s cell at the time of the escape.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nAnother security feed, like the one of Scarecrow’s cell. This time, the door is open, but it’s the RIDDLER who struts out.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Of course, this message came from outside, and Nygma was *one* of the escapees.\n\n**Panel Two**\nOracle, still inside the feed, is looking up at the camera.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) So… did he have *help?*\n\n**Panel Three**\nOracle is emerging from the security feed like a window.\n\n1. ORACLE: Is there anything else stored on the server under that same encryption?\n\n**Panel Four**\nA very large array of panes of text drop down, surrounding Oracle.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Well, *that’s* a yes.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on one of the panes. Oracle is brushing a hand across it. The gibberish text turns to a legible message with her touch. The text reads:\n\n1. TEXT: **Automatonophobia:** Getting chronophobic, claustrophobic, and more than a little nosocomephobic. We should enact our plans soon.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) I imagine that was supposed to be a mysterious codename.\n\n**Panel Six**\nOracle makes a swiping motion, and several text panes move past her in a blur.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Seeing a lot from Crane, a lot from this “Superego” guy, and a lot from somebody going by “Sophocles.”\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of two that starts like the previous six-panel grids, and then a row of three with slightly irregular sizes and shapes (they’re each almost, but not quite, the same height and almost, but not quite, the same width). Finally, a row of one with a small inset panel in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Panel One**\nOracle looks at another pane.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) “Sophocles” is probably a reference to the playwright of *Oedipus Rex*, which concerns the mythological hero who solved the Riddle of the Sphinx. For a guy who prides himself on being confusing and obtuse, Nygma is awfully predictable.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) But then who is-\n\n**Panel Two**\nOracle is grabbing her head.\n\n1. ORACLE: AH!\n\n**Panel Three**\nSuddenly, we’re back to reality with a low closeup. Oracle has ripped the mask off and is reaching for a box of tissues on her desk.\n\n**Panel Four**\nOracle coughs into a tissue.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Some sort of… feedback? Hasn’t happened before.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShe’s still doubled over and staring concernedly at the tissue.\n\n1. SFX: (From off-panel) Bzzzt! Bzzzzt!\n\n2. ORACLE: What *now?*\n\n**Panel Six**\nShe leaves the tissue on the shelf and moves back to the computers. Our view is next to the tissue and we see it’s stained a deep red.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nCloseup on Oracle, looking annoyed.\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe see over her shoulder. A security feed on the monitor shows BATMAN standing outside the door on the roof, arms folded.\n\n1. BATMAN: (From the monitor) Barbara? We need to *talk.*\n\n2. ORACLE: Oh, *now* you want to continue our discussion?\n\n3. BATMAN: (Monitor) I’m sorry?\n\n4. ORACLE: (Cap) The hell does he mea-\n\n5. ORACLE: (Cap) Hm.\n\n6. ORACLE: Never mind. Just come in.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot over Babs’ shoulder as Batman enters. She’s laced her fingers. His head is cocked.\n\n1. ORACLE: Something you need, Bruce?\n\n2. BATMAN: Maybe. Is this a bad time?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Babs, looking down, noting that she’s still in her bathrobe.\n\n1. ORACLE: Hm? Oh, sorry. Long night.\n\n**Panel Four**\nTwo-shot as Batman approaches.\n\n1. BATMAN: I had a… *concerning* conversation with J’onn recently.\n\n2. ORACLE: Oh?\n\n3. BATMAN: He believes the Omega File has been stolen.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBack to Babs. Her brow is furrowed.\n\n1. ORACLE: That shouldn’t be possible. Only he and I have access.\n\n2. BATMAN: Well… that’s just it.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of two and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Batman, frowning.\n\n1. BATMAN: He wanted to know who you were. I didn’t tell him. I trust you, of course.\n\n2. ORACLE: Of course.\n\n3. BATMAN: … But then I thought of the number of different forms of mind control and shapeshifting we’ve encountered. You’ve even *nearly* been compromised by *mundane* blackmail in the past*.\n\n4. CAPTION: *In Birds of Prey #56-60 (first series). – ReferenceHappyJamags\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot over Batman’s shoulder. Babs has moved away, closer to a beaten-up chest on the floor.\n\n1. ORACLE: That’s not fair.\n\n2. BATMAN: I *did* say “nearly.”\n\n3. ORACLE: That was only *your* identity at stake. The Omega File? That’s *everyone’s* identity, and *then* some. I’d *never* risk that. Not for anyone.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from inside the chest. Babs is reaching into it.\n\n1. BATMAN: I’m not *saying* you would.\n\n2. ORACLE: Then… what *are* you saying?\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot past Oracle’s shoulder as she approaches Batman.\n\n1. BATMAN: Chiefly, that you’re in the best position to discover if and *how* this happened and I’d like your help.\n\n2. BATMAN: Secondly, that if something *is* wrong… I hope *I* can help *you.*\n\n**Panel Five**\nFrom Batman’s POV, looking down at Oracle, who’s rolled *right* up to him.\n\n1. ORACLE: Just one other question.\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SPLASH**\nStill from Batman’s POV. Babs reveals that what she removed from the chest is a FLARE, which she has lit and is shoving in his face.\n\n1. ORACLE: Does *this* bother you?\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nOracle’s POV. Batman has one eyebrow raised quizzically. The flare is still burning in front of him.\n\n1. BATMAN: Not… especially?\n\n2. ORACLE: Oh, thank *God.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nBack out to the two-shot.\n\n1. ORACLE: I don’t suppose you *told* J’onn my identity.\n\n2. BATMAN: And he assured me he wouldn’t read my mind. I take it he lied?\n\n3. ORACLE: He showed up as you a little while ago. Gave me the third degree and then split.\n\n4. BATMAN: (Quietly) *Damn* you, J’onn.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Batman rubbing his chin.\n\n1. BATMAN: Though… if he’s willing to force the issue telepathically on this case, he should *know* you’re innocent now, right?\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Babs. She’s smiling and adjusting her glasses.\n\n1. ORACLE: … Yeah. Yeah, he should\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of one and two rows of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot from behind Babs, watching Batman swing away through the clock face.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShe moves over to the old chest.\n\n1. ORACLE: Even after all this time, you’re *still* solving cases.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBabs opens up the chest, revealing her BATGIRL uniform. She’s replacing the flare in its utility belt.\n\n1. ORACLE: Congratulations, Batgirl.\n\n2. SFX: (From off-panel) Deet! Deet! Deet!\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from Oracle’s computers as she returns.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Can’t catch a *break* today.\n\n2. ORACLE: I’m in a lousy mood, Dinah. *Please* have good news.\n\n**Panel Five**\nExtreme closeup of BLACK CANARY.\n\n1. BLACK CANARY: In that case… They tell me the Star City Rockets are a shoo-in for the playoffs.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – THREE PANELS**\nA splash with inserts in the top left and bottom right.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Babs with her head in her hands.\n\n1. ORACLE: All right, all right. What’s gone horribly wrong?\n\n**Panel Two**\nWide shot of Black Canary leaning against a post on a small dock, a water bottle in one hand and her jacket draped over her shoulder with the other. Behind her is a tropical island. Aside from the dock itself, there’s no indication of human presence.\n\n1. BLACK CANARY: Nothing. In fact, nothing’s happening at all. As far as I can tell, the island’s *empty.* Deserted. Ghostville, USA. Or, uh, Ghostville, Bahamas, I guess.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Via Communicator) Joy.\n\n3. BLACK CANARY: You *do* sound down. Let me guess; you haven’t slept in some obscenely long time.\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) Twelve hou-\n\n5. BLACK CANARY: I just want you to know that if the next sentence out of your mouth contains the word “power nap,” I will reach through the internet and punch you. When was the last time you slept for *longer than twenty minutes?*\n\n6. ORACLE: (Comm) … Three days.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup. Babs is rubbing her eyes.\n\n1. BLACK CANARY: (Comm) Holy $#!%, Babs.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Yeah, here comes the lecture. Probably better if I *don’t* tell her that it’s really been three *weeks.*\n\n3. ORACLE: Look, I-\n\n4. BLACK CANARY: (Comm) Look, *nothing.* Go to *sleep. I’ll* keep looking for your tech pirates.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nFull shot. Black Canary is stepping off the dock, grabbing her hair with one hand.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) I feel *fine,* Dinah.\n\n2. BLACK CANARY: No, you *don’t.* You feel *sleep-deprived* is how you *feel.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nSimilar angle relative to Canary, but she’s entering the jungle.\n\n1. BLACK CANARY: Given that I can’t *actually* cyberpunch you, at least make yourself useful: what am I looking for?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Probably some kind of antenna or satellite. If you get a good vantage point, you should be able to spot it.\n\n**Panel Three**\nLow angle from behind Canary. We can see that there’s a mountain in the middle of the island, possibly a dormant shield volcano.\n\n1. BLACK CANARY: I have a *thought* on that front.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) And?\n\n3. BLACK CANARY: It might take a couple hours. Just enough time for you to *go to sleep.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Oracle. She’s rubbing her temple but smiling despite herself.\n\n1. ORACLE: Yes, *mother.*\n\n2. BLACK CANARY: (Comm) And you’d better not be *lying.*\n\n3. ORACLE: How would you *know?*\n\n4. BLACK CANARY: (Comm) I’m *serious* here. I don’t need you zonking out on me when I’m under fire.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – THREE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot past Oracle’s computer screen. She’s clearly still working.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) Dinah has a point.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) But I wasn’t just making excuses. I really don’t feel tired at all.\n\n**Panel Two**\nWide shot of Black Canary climbing the mountain. The slope is steep but vaguely walkable. It’s clear she’s been climbing through a *lot* of silt and gravel, though.\n\n**Panel Three**\nBack to Oracle. Roughly the same position and angle.\n\n1. BLACK CANARY: (Comm) I hope I’m waking you up.\n\n2. ORACLE: Yep.\n\n3. BLACK CANARY: (Comm) I’ll never understand how you aren’t a better liar. So, good news: I *did* find the cyber-bad-guys’ base…\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-TWO – SPLASH**\nBlack Canary is now on top of the mountain. We’re looking over her shoulder down at a bay on the far side of the island from the dock. In the bay is a large, slightly futuristic SUBMARINE.\n\n1. BLACK CANARY: … But it’s not exactly *on* the island.\n\n2.

I wonder how they ensure a reliable-\n\n4. CANARY: Nerd later. Tactics now.\n\n6. ORACLE: (Cap) Let me get you up to speed: Black Canary is investigating a ring of cyber-criminals for me. They crack bank accounts, steal identities, run blackmail schemes, start scams, and seem to do a lot of *pirating.* I was able to trace their location, but I can’t access their systems without a presence on the ground.

Their security is going to be *literally* airtight. Are there *any* permanent facilities in the vicinity?\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot of the sub through binoculars.\n\n1. CANARY: Funny. No. How do they resupply?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Underground facility?\n\n3. CANARY: More than one base?\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) Meets up with another ship?\n\n5.

ORACLE: (Comm) … What?\n\n**Panel Three**\nA low angle in front of the UBO (**U**nidentified **B**lue **O**bject) reveals it as Blue Beetle’s BUG.\n\n1. BEETLE: (From inside the Bug) I see how it is.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) This is Ted Kord, one of two active Blue Beetles. I had him on standby to deal with a *situation* in the Swiss Alps. Obviously, he’s stopped standing and started going.\n\n**Panel Four**\nInside. TED KORD has the Bug on autopilot and his feet propped up on the steering wheel.\n\n1. BEETLE: Just *ignore* ol’ Ted, then.\n\n2. BEETLE: I’m just fine.\n\n3. BEETLE: Don’t need to know where I’m going.\n\n4. BEETLE: I’ll just sit back. Relax.

BEETLE: Sometimes you’re no fun at all.\n\n**Panel Six**\nOracle is glaring over the top of her glasses, not that Beetle can see.\n\n1. ORACLE: This is serious. How much do you know about *Christopher Smith?*\n\n2. BEETLE: … Oh.\n\n3. BEETLE: Enough.\n\n**PAGE FOUR – EIGHT PANELS**\nUpper half: four-panel grid. Lower half: four-panel grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCanary is crouched behind a tree near the beach. The sub is still visible beyond. We have a better sense of the scale now, and it’s *huge,* at least as submarines go. Perhaps some 400 feet in length.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShe’s down on the beach, approaching the waterline.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on a panel on the hull sliding open.\n\n**Panel Four**\nA large machine gun with some kind of sensor attached to it pops out of the panel.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBeetle has stood up and walked over to a shelf full of gadgets. He’s fiddling with his BB Gun.\n\n1. BEETLE: Smith runs the Pax Institute out there. Big charity, they do good work.\n\n2. BEETLE: But I’m guessing you know that Smith is actually the Peacemaker.\n\n3. ORACLE: (Comm) Yes.\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot of the PEACEMAKER firing a very large gun. We don’t see who he’s shooting at and the background is blurry.\n\n1. BEETLE: (Cap) “Gun-toting loony who, quote, ‘Loves peace so much he’ll kill for it,’ en quote.”\n\n2. BEETLE: (Cap) “Violent, paranoid, and talks to people who aren’t there. *Nasty* customer, even if he likes to *think* he’s one of the good guys.”\n\n**Panel Seven**\nBack to Oracle.\n\n1. ORACLE: Some… *other* associates of mine ran into the Peacemaker and I’ve been monitoring him since.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Namely, the Suicide Squad. Kobra tried to play them, Project Peacemaker, the Captain Atom Project, Checkmate, and the *Force of July* of all people against each other. It was resolved, but things got ugly for a while.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nOracle leans in closer to the reader.\n\n1.

CANARY: Oracle, I think they know I’m here!\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot over Oracle’s shoulder as she turns to a different monitor, which displays a map of the island.\n\n1. SFX: (From the monitor) BRAKKA BRAKKA BRAKKA!\n\n2. ORACLE: You weren’t careful, were you?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCanary peeks around the edge of the rock.\n\n1. CANARY: Shut up!\n\n**Panel Four**\nExtreme closeup on Canary’s hand grabbing a small stone.\n\n1. CANARY: I’m going to try something stupid. Turn your volume down.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShe tosses the rock in the air.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) This does not sound careful.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe rock is propelled forward directly towards the reader by the force of Dinah’s CANARY CRY.\n\n1. SFX: EEEEEEEE-\n\n**Panel Seven**\nShot from above. The Bug is passing over farmland.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nOn Beetle, steering.\n\n1. BEETLE: You’re lucky I had business with KO’s * London branch. Response time would be murder if I were in the States.\n\n2. CAPTION: * Kord Omniversal, Ted’s company.\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) I don’t believe in luck.\n\n**Panel Nine**\nPull in closer. He has a quizzical expression on his face.\n\n1. BEETLE: Uh, Oracle? You there?\n\n**Panel Ten**\nOracle leans back over to a monitor showing a video feed of Beetle.\n\n1. ORACLE: Just a sec-\n\n**Panel Eleven**\nOn Beetle again.\n\n1. BEETLE: Am I distracting-\n\n**Panel Twelve**\nBeetle recoils from the comm unit in the Bug’s dashboard.\n\n1. SFX: eeeeeeee-\n\n2. BEETLE: *Ow.* What is *that* noise?\n\n3. ORACLE: The sound of someone not being careful.\n\n**PAGE SIX – SEVEN PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of four. Lower half: Row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe rock is striking the sensor on the turret, disrupting its aim.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Cap) I have *no* idea what she’s doing down there.\n\n**Panel Two**\nLow angle as Canary dashes across the beach.\n\n**Panel Three**\nIn the water. The waterline divides our view and we see Canary diving in.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe panels that were covering the gun are beginning to slide shut, but Canary’s hand is grabbing onto one of them.\n\n1. CANARY: Think *again,* bucko.\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe Bug sweeps over the Paris skyline.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) I have a *mole* in the Pax Institute. For three years, Smith’s mental state was making progress. Then, a month or two ago, he suddenly relapsed.\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot over Ted’s shoulder at his viewscreen, which only displays Oracle’s icon.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Became paranoid. Ranting about some sort of government conspiracy to control the world’s metahumans.\n\n2. BEETLE: Uh *huh.*\n\n3. ORACLE: (Comm) I thought so too. Then the entire Institute went dark.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nBeetle rests his chin on a fist.\n\n1. BEETLE: Dark how?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) No one who’s gone to their headquarters has been heard from in days.\n\n3. BEETLE: Think Smith went *postal?*\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of three. Lower half: Row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nCanary is crouching next to the gun as it recedes into the sub and the armor panels close above her.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShe’s crammed inside a small chamber where the gun is stored. We can see another access panel leading further into the sub.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCanary tugs on the access panel to no effect.\n\n1. CANARY: … I *probably* should’ve been more careful.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from behind the Bug. It’s approaching the Alps.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) *Maybe.* But I’m worried that he, and by extension the Institute as a whole, knew too much.\n\n2. BEETLE: Well, we’ll find out soon.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Beetle. Mountains are reflected in his goggles.\n\n1. BEETLE: Coming up on the mission site.\n\n2. ORACLE: Wait…\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – SIX PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of three. Lower half: Row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Canary. She looks nervous.\n\n1. CANARY: Hey, Oracle?\n\n**Panel Two**\nPull out. Water has started to pour into the small compartment from cracks in the armor panels above.\n\n1. CANARY: Oracle, can you hear me?\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe water level is rising.\n\n1. CANARY: Aw, *crap.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Oracle.\n\n1. ORACLE: … I think I just lost contact with Dinah.\n\n2. BEETLE: (Comm) Is she here? Tell her I’m sorry about Kooey Kooey Kooey.\n\n3. ORACLE: Unrelated mission. How close are you?\n\n4. ORACLE: (Cap) They can jam our comms? I’m still seeing activity from them. I have *got* to take a look at this hardware.\n\n**Panel Five**\nLow angle on a building with the name PAX across it. The Bug is hovering above.\n\n1. BEETLE: I’m *pretty* close.\n\n**Panel Six**\nFrom inside the cockpit. We look at a half-open set of hangar doors in the roof of the Institute building. They look damaged.\n\n1. ORACLE: There should be a landing pad. Visual?\n\n2. BEETLE: Sort of. I can get in.\n\n**PAGE NINE – SEVEN PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of three. Lower half: Four-panel grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCanary, looking closely at the crack the water is pouring through.\n\n1. CANARY: OK, Dinah, *think.* That other door is probably meant to reload these guns. This is probably an airlock.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShe turns her attention to the access panel.\n\n1. CANARY: So it’ll drain. Unless they *know* I’m in here.\n\n2. CANARY: Or I *broke* it.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShe’s reaching down into the water, but at this point it’s hard to see what she’s doing. The water is splashing up over her mouth.\n\n1. CANARY: If I ever get out of this, I am *so* going to (SFX: glub)\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from the floor of the hangar. Beetle is dropping through the gap in the doors via a line from the Bug.\n\n1. BEETLE: Couldn’t have landed in here anyway.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from above through the opening. We see Peacemaker’s personal aircraft, a silver, helicopter-like vehicle powered by jets rather than propellers.\n\n1. BEETLE: *Nice* ride.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) I know, right?\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) I bet that submarine is cooler, though.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBeetle lands on the ground.\n\n1. BEETLE: *Oof.* Been a while since I did the whole acro- Oh, whoa.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) I can’t see you anymore, Ted; use your words.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nShot over Ted’s shoulder. He’s kneeling over the corpse of a middle-aged man in mechanic’s coveralls.\n\n1. BEETLE: We’ve got a body. Shot in the back.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) #&@%.\n\n**PAGE TEN – SEVEN PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of three. Lower half: Row of four.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot inside a cabin inside the submarine. Two access panels like the one in the turret housing are present. A woman dressed in all black (like a henchman from an Adam West Batman episode or a Bond film) is entering through a hatch, carrying an ammo belt. Canary kicks open one of the access panels from inside as water spills fourth.\n\n1. HENCHWOMAN: (SFX: Gasp)\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Canary, soaking wet and very angry.\n\n1. CANARY: I’m sure marinated canary is a delicacy *somewhere* in the world, but honey, I am *not* on the menu.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCanary peeks out of the door. We can see the now-unconscious henchwoman’s foot on the floor in the background.\n\n1. CANARY: (Whispering) And in case you were wondering, no self-respecting superhero leaves home without a lockpicking kit.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBeetle cautiously emerges into the well-appointed halls of the Pax Institute. There are more bodies. There’s *some* battle damage, but it’s minimal relative to the number of deaths.\n\n1. BEETLE: More dead. Efficient work, too.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) #&@%. #&@% #&@% *#&@%.* Any of the bodies armed?\n\n3. BEETLE: … No.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBeetle is leaning into a doorway, his BB Gun at the ready. Inside is just an office, a man slumped over at his desk.\n\n1. BEETLE: What am I looking for here, Rolls?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) See if you can find my contact. Smith’s *handlers* were undercover in his staff. My contact worked in his command center.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Beetle.\n\n1. BEETLE: Handlers? Smith is a spook?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) *He* didn’t know it.\n\n3. BEETLE: Think that’s what set him off?\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) Is it wrong that I hope that’s *all* that set him off?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nShot from in front of Beetle, continuing down the hallway.\n\n1. BEETLE: *Everything* about this is wrong.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Maybe I could’ve prevented this if I’d done something earlier.\n\n3. BEETLE: Maybe so.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – SEVEN PANELS**\nUpper half: Four-panel grid. Lower half: Row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nCanary jogs down a passageway. A henchman is stepping out of a hatch along the side and looking at her in surprise.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCanary kicks his head into the metal hatch.\n\n1. SFX: *CLANG!*\n\n2. CANARY: Thanks for getting the *door.*\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from above of Canary climbing a ladder.\n\n**Panel Four**\nAnother hatch flies open as Canary bursts into the sub’s conn. More henchmen leap to their feet in shock.\n\n1. SFX: *CLANG!*\n\n2. CANARY: You boys have some real *sub*par security.\n\n**Panel Five**\nWe’re in a large, dark room with several monitor stations. There are a couple more bodies.\n\n1. BEETLE: This looks like a command center. What’s your contact look like?\n\n**Panel Six**\nBeetle is kneeling next to a corpse that’s slumped in the corner.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Female, mid-‘40s, brown hair, glasses. See anything?\n\n2. BEETLE: Yeah. I do.\n\n3. ORACLE: (Comm) Damn it. Does she have anything *on* her?\n\n4. BEETLE: A nice suit.\n\n5. ORACLE: (Comm) $#!%.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nBlue Beetle holds up a small box with a microphone.\n\n1. BEETLE: *And* an old-fashioned voice recorder. Not a cell?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Never know who’s listening to those things. Play it.\n\n3. RECORDER: (Elec) Oracle? Olive. It’s… It’s all gone *wrong.*\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – SEVEN PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of three. Lower half: Four-panel grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nThree henchmen are charging Canary, but she punches the one in front, sending him sprawling.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCanary has the second henchman by the arm and throws him to the ground.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCanary elbows the third henchman in the nose.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBeetle keeps watch on the door as the recorder continues to play.\n\n1. RECORDER: (Elec) W-we thought we had it under control. Sure, Smith was getting suspicious of the *Agency* but he didn’t know anything about *us.*\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from one of the monitors as Beetle approaches. There’s another slumped-over body in front of it.\n\n1. RECORDER: (Elec) But then he… he found Doctor D’Abo’s reports. He *knows* it’s all a lie.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Oracle, her fingers interlaced as she listens.\n\n1. RECORDER: (Comm) And Bridgette… she told the Agency. They said… they said they were going to “clean up.” Their goons are everywhere.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nCloseup on Beetle, grimacing.\n\n1. RECORDER: (Elec) I think they’re going to kill Christophe- (SFX: BANG! BANG!) Oh God. What was that? (SFX: BANG!)\n\n2. BEETLE: The “Agency.” Which one?\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – EIGHT PANELS**\nUpper half: A row of three and a row of two. Lower half: Row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nBack to Oracle.\n\n1. ORACLE: Smith’s handlers worked for-\n\n2. CANARY: (Comm) -hear me? Repeat, are you *there,* Oracle?\n\n3. ORACLE: Dinah! What happened!\n\n**Panel Two**\nIn the sub’s conn, Canary stands in the middle of several unconscious henchmen.\n\n1. CANARY: Sub had a jammer. I switched it off, but there are still a few baddies around, and I can’t tell who’s *running* this show.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Good. You still have the transmitter I gave you?\n\n3. CANARY: … Is it waterproof?\n\n4. ORACLE: (Comm) (SFX: Sigh)\n\n**Panel Three**\nOracle is rubbing her temple.\n\n1. ORACLE: Look. Just… Find their computers. I’ll see what I can talk you through.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Canary making a fist.\n\n1. CANARY: Shouldn’t be too hard. The crew have actually kinda been pushovers so far.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Not to besmirch my own noble profession, but they’re *hackers,* Canary. What were you expecting, ninjas?\n\n3. CANARY: It’s been a *while* since I had a good ninja fight. And if I *have* to settle for pirates, I’d kind of prefer the cutlass-and-eyepatch kind to the stream-movies-for-free kind.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCanary whirls, surprised.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) Happy to be obligin’ ye, lass.\n\n2. CANARY: Oh, you’ve *got* to be kidding me.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBeetle has his arms folded and is frowning.\n\n1. BEETLE: Why do you always get distracted *right* when you’re about to tell me something important?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nHe starts poking at the console.\n\n1. BEETLE: Well, I understand *most* of the situation, other than the critically important information you haven’t told me yet, so I’m going to look for Smith.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nCloseup on the screen. It’s a map of the Institute, with a beacon marked “Helmet Tracer.” Two other, larger blips are outside, marked “Unidentified 1” and “Unidentified 2.” As indicated by its position directly next to the hangar, Unidentified 1 is the Bug, but Unidentified 2 is new and still approaching.\n\n1. BEETLE: *There* you are.\n\n2. SFX: (Near the unidentified blip) Bee-DEEP!\n\n3. BEETLE: Ruh-roh. Company.\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nUpper half: Splash. Lower half: Row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over Canary’s shoulder. Entering the room flanked by two more henchmen is indeed a man with a cutlass and a (robotic) eyepatch. He’s got pirate boots. He’s got a sweet cape. He’s got a tricorne hat. He’s got a skull mask. Sadly, I did *not* create this character, but I *really wish* I had.\n\n1. CAP’N FEAR: Ahoy and avast! Thought ye’d board *my* vessel wit’out a fight, did ye? Well, not if *Cap’n Fear* has anyt’ing ta say about it!\n\n2. CANARY: Are… Are you for real?\n\n3. CAP’N FEAR: Make light o’ me at yer peril, wench!\n\n4. CANARY: Oh my God, you *are* for real.\n\n**Panel Two**\nBeetle is running down the hallway.\n\n1. BEETLE: Oracle, I think I (SFX: huff) found Smith, but we’ve got (SFX: huff) visitors.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from the top of a staircase. He’s bounding up three steps at a time.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) What kind of visitors?\n\n2. BEETLE: No (SFX: huff) idea. That (SFX: huff) “Agency?”\n\n**Panel Four**\nBeetle bursts through door. He looks surprised.\n\n1.

Lower half: Row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Cap’n Fear, pointing.\n\n1. CAP’N FEAR: Cleave ‘er to the brisket, mateys!\n\n2. HENCHMAN 1: You got it, boss.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCap’n Fear turns to glare at the henchman, who adjusts his glasses nervously.\n\n1. HENCHMAN 1: I… mean… Aye, aye, Captain. The scurvy bilge rat will be dancing with Jack Ketch before the day is done. Ahem.\n\n2. HENCHMAN 2: Arr.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe two henchmen, also brandishing cutlasses, approach Canary.\n\n**Panel Four**\nWe’re in a comfortable study on an upper floor of the Institute. Beetle is kneeling next to PEACEMAKER’S HELMET, which is discarded on the floor next to a few guns, a belt, and some pieces of body armor. In the background, the window is shattered.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Crap? What’s crap? What are you seeing?\n\n2. BEETLE: I found Smith’s *gear,* but no *Smith.*\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Beetle from below. He’s looking down at something in surprise.\n\n1. BEETLE: Wait, what is-\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on what was underneath the helmet: a BOMB. There’s a timer with writing scrawled above it.\n\n1. WRITING: MATE IN:\n\n2. TIMER: 03\n\n3. SFX: *Beep!*\n\n4. BEETLE: (Off-panel) Oh $#!%!\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nUpper half: Four-panel grid. Lower half: Splash.\n\n**Panel One**\nCanary is disarming Henchman 2.\n\n1. HENCHMAN 2: *Arr!*\n\n**Panel Two**\nShe parries a strike from Henchman 1 as Cap’n Fear approaches.\n\n1. HENCHMAN 1: Aw, $#!%. Or, uh, *bilge.* Whatever.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCanary delivers a spinning kick to Henchman 1’s head as she turns to face Cap’n Fear.\n\n1. CANARY: I’d keelhaul you just for your lousy pirate voice, swabby.\n\n2. CAP’N FEAR: Ye’ve got spirit, wench, I’ll be givin’ ye that!\n\n**Panel Four**\nPull in close as Cap’n Fear and Canary cross swords, Fear clearly having the upper hand.\n\n1. CANARY: I was talking to *you.*\n\n2. CAP’N FEAR: ***AARRRGH!***\n\n**Panel Five**\nLow angle from outside the Pax Institute. An explosion is visible bursting through the windows near the top floor.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) ***TED!***\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of two. Lower half: Four-panel grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCanary stumbles backwards out of the path of a cutlass slash by Cap’n Fear.\n\n1. CAP’N FEAR: Does that be *Fear* I see in yer eyes, lassie?\n\n2. CANARY: Don’t pat yourself on the back so hard, Cap’n. I wasn’t expecting one of you people to actually *know* how to use a sword.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCanary lunges back at Cap’n Fear, and he parries her attack somewhat awkwardly.\n\n1. CANARY: You know, this is kind of fun!\n\n2. CAP’N FEAR: I’ll make ye eat those words and wash ‘em down with saltwater!\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) Oh, *Dinah.* Just *hit* him.\n\n**Panel Three**\nIn the hallway outside the room with the bomb. Beetle is crumpled against the wall.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Ted! *Ted!* Come on, Beebs, show me a *sign* here.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBeetle is struggling shakily to his feet.\n\n1. BEETLE: That… wouldn’t be *worry* I detect… would it?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Just a *mild* panic attack. Are you in one piece?\n\n3. BEETLE: Everything *hurts* but nothing’s *broken.* I got out of the way just in time.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBeetle, grinning.\n\n1. BEETLE: I guess I’ve still got it.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe same angle, but he’s looking to the side, surprised.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) Don’t move or you’re *going* to get it.\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of three. Lower half: Splash.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide shot of Canary and Cap’n Fear swordfighting. Canary’s doing better now that she’s got her footing, but she’s dueling Fear with his own weapon of choice, and he’s still driving her back.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Are you *still* fighting this guy? Just drop the sword and *punch* him.\n\n2. CANARY: Oh, *shush.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nCanary kicks Cap’n Fear back as she steps back dangerously close to the ladder she climbed up before.\n\n1. CANARY: I’ve *got* this.\n\n**Panel Three**\nSimilar crossed-swords panel to Page 16 Panel 4, but with positions reversed.\n\n1. CANARY: *Don’t* I, Cap’n?\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Showoff.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBeetle looks up at the new arrival, a woman in a long, heavy coat with a green uniform underneath. Readers of the original Birds of Prey series or my own Captain Atom series will probably recognize Katarina Armstrong, the SPY SMASHER.\n\n1. SPY SMASHER: … Actually, please *do* move. I’d *like* an excuse to put one through your skull.\n\n2. ORACLE: (Comm) Um, Beebs? What’s going on?\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) Because I *really* hope I’m wrong, and I actually *don’t* recognize that voice.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – EIGHT PANELS**\nUpper half: Four-panel grid with a fifth, portrait-shaped panel to the right of the whole grid. Lower half: Row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup. Canary’s sword clips Cap’n Fear’s hand. He drops his sword.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot over Cap’n Fear’s shoulder as he stumbles back. Canary advances, flourishing with the sword. However, another HENCHMAN is emerging from the ladder well behind her.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe henchman moves to grab Canary from behind. She turns to elbow him in the chest.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCap’n Fear pulls a GUN and fires, grazing Canary’s side.\n\n1. SFX: BANG!\n\n2. CANARY: *Ah!*\n\n3. ORACLE: (Comm) Dinah!\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from the top of the ladder as Canary plunges towards the bottom.\n\n1. ORACLE: (Comm) Come in!\n\n**Panel Six**\nBeetle rolls through the doorway and out of Spy Smasher’s line of fire, blasting back with his BB Gun.\n\n1. BEETLE: Didn’t your mother ever tell you it’s not *nice* to point guns at strangers?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nSpy Smasher turns and starts shooting *through* the wall, forcing Beetle to dive for cover again.\n\n1. SPY SMASHER: Didn’t *yours* ever tell you not to work for megalomaniacs?\n\n2. BEETLE: Huh?!\n\n3. ORACLE: (Cap) I’m with Beetle. I’ve been called a lot of unkind things and even *deserved* some of them, but that’s a new one.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nBeetle is starting to get to his feet, but Spy Smasher already has him in her sights again.\n\n1. SPY SMASHER: We can do this the hard way or the you-bleeding-out-all-over-the-Alps way.\n\n2. BEETLE: Dare I ask why there’s no easy way?\n\n3. SPY SMASHER: You *shot* at me.\n\n4. BEETLE: Fair.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SIX PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of three. Lower half: Row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nBlack.\n\n**Panel Two**\nSmall, blurry field in the middle of the panel, indicating we’re looking through Canary’s POV as she opens her eyes.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe view clears up. She’s looking up at Cap’n Fear and is surrounded by him and six other henchmen.\n\n1. CANARY: Uh-oh.\n\n**Panel Four**\nSpy Smasher has Beetle by the scruff of the neck and slams him against the wall.\n\n1. SPY SMASHER: What does Lord want here?\n\n2. BEETLE: Lord?! You mean *Max?*\n\n**Panel Five**\nSpy Smasher punches Beetle, sending him sprawling.\n\n1. SFX: *Whack!*\n\n2. SPY SMASHER: *Don’t* play stupid; it clearly comes naturally.\n\n**Panel Six**\nBeetle tries to rise to a sitting position but Spy Smasher plants a boot on his chest.\n\n1. SPY SMASHER: I’m supposed to believe *you* showed up *here* and he didn’t have anything to do with it?\n\n2. BEETLE: Look, lady. Humor me and assume I don’t see the connection between Max and the Institute.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – SEVEN PANELS**\nUpper half: Row of three. Lower half: Row of four.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Cap’n Fear leaning in towards Canary.\n\n1. CAP’N FEAR: Mostwise, lassie, I’d skin ye alive and hang ye from the yardarm.\n\n2.

CAP’N FEAR: But ye made me *mad,* lass.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCap’n Fear backs away, gesturing behind him. We don’t quite get a good look at where he’s pointing.\n\n1. CAP’N FEAR: *That’s* why we arranged fer *this.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Spy Smasher.\n\n1. SPY SMASHER: You *are* a pest. This is a *Checkmate* facility. Who do you think *runs* Checkmate, numb(spoiler)(/spoiler)nuts?\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Beetle. He actually looks sort of distraught.\n\n1. BEETLE: I had no *idea!* I haven’t seen Max in years!\n\n**Panel Six**\nBack to Spy Smasher. She looks confused.\n\n1. SPY SMASHER: You’re serious, aren’t you? Then who sent-\n\n**Panel Seven**\nHer expression changes to one of anger.\n\n1. SPY SMASHER: ***Gordon.***\n\n2. ORACLE: (Cap) Well, $#!%. That’s Kat, all right.

Lower half: Splash.\n\n**Panel One**\nPull out. Cap’n Fear is pointing to a large round hole in the floor, possibly meant for a diving bell, though no such craft is visible. A wooden board is laid out so its end is in the middle of the hole. A henchman is knelt next to the hole, chumming the water. Dark, suspiciously shark-shaped shadows circle below.\n\n1. CAP’N FEAR: It’s time for ye to ***walk the plank!***\n\n2. CAPTION: Continued next month!\n\n**Panel Two**\nBeetle and Spy Smasher look to face the new arrival. He’s helmetless, but from his uniform, one can still recognize the PEACEMAKER, aiming an assault rifle.\n\n1. PEACEMAKER: This is a place of *peace,* and by God, you will *not* defile it any further!\n\n2. BEETLE: Hoo *boy.*\n\n3. SPY SMASHER: You have *got* to be $#!%%ing me.\n\n4.

Energy crackles around him and a bright light glints on the reflective silver coating covering him.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Caption) “You want to know about Captain Atom? That’s all in the past. *Way* in the past.”\n\n2. UNKNOWN 2: (Cap) “Not as far as you *think,* Colonel. Fill me in.”\n\n3. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “You might want to sit down. It’s a bit of a yarn.”\n\n4. UNKNOWN 2: (Cap) “I’ll sit if and when I feel the need. Stop stalling.”\n\n**PAGE TWO – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nIn the foreground, a man in an Air Force General’s uniform, GENERAL LEMAR to be specific, is slumped over at his desk, dead. We’re at enough of an angle to glimpse the handle of the combat knife sticking out of his chest. In the background, another man in the uniform of a Captain, NATHANIEL ADAM, is backing up in shock. To the right is a door, through which several MPs are bursting.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “Almost thirty years ago now, Captain Nathaniel Adam was court martialed for murdering General Colin Lemar.\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe inside of a prison cell. Nathaniel is sitting on his bed, staring at the floor. Past the bars, we see Colonel WADE EILING, his hands folded behind his back.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “He was framed, of course. That was General—Or, uh, at the time, *Colonel* Wade Eiling’s doing, not that Adam ever knew. Eiling ran a little conspiracy called the ‘Green Elite.’”\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe silhouetted figures of Eiling and Doctor HEINRICH MEGALA are in a dark room, watching a view screen of Nathaniel strapped to a large machine. Surrounding him are panels of a silvery substance that resembles Captain Atom’s “armor.”\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “This was where *Megala* came in.”\n\n2. NATHANIEL: The bad news is you only have 24 hours to live. ‘Sheesh’, says the friend. ‘*What* could be *worse* than that?’\n\n3. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “Heinrich Megala and his crew of eggheads had discovered some sort of alien metal with weird energy-conducting properties. They believed it could protect a human from a point-blank nuclear blast. So, our hero, on death row anyway, got volunteered to test it out.”\n\n**Panel Four**\nHigh angle of a smoking crater in the desert. It’s large as craters go, but orders of magnitude smaller than it should be for a nuclear blast site.\n\n1.

Behind it is Nathaniel, now wearing his silver second skin, collapsed to his knees. Eiling is standing behind him again.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “Something else.”\n\n2. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “I can’t say the Captain and I were ever *friends,* exactly, but it must’ve hurt to find out his wife was dead. To find out that she’d been married to Eiling, of all people. To be denied the chance to even *see* his kids.”\n\n**PAGE THREE – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe see Captain Atom again, posing in front of an American flag. He’s smiling, but it doesn’t quite reach his eyes.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “That’s why he agreed to become Captain Atom for us. To put it bluntly, it was blackmail.”\n\n**Panel Two**\nThis panel is a closeup, split down the middle. One half is Captain Atom, while the other is Nathaniel, his hair now stark white. The name on his uniform is also “SCOTT,” not Adam.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “We rolled him out, built up to look like any other superhero. Trumped-up backstory, bogus rogues gallery, even a phony secret identity. His papers *still* say ‘Cameron Scott,’ not Nathaniel Adam.”\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot of a TV news desk. Captain Atom is giving an interview with an anchor.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “A little media magic and he was on his way to the big time.”\n\n**Panel Four**\nWide shot of Captain Atom shaking hands with the MARTIAN MANHUNTER in front of the UNITED NATIONS. MAXWELL LORD is between the two with a hand on each one’s shoulder. The JUSTICE LEAGUE of the time is behind Manhunter. FIRE, ICE, and BLUE BEETLE are close to the foreground. Further back are BLACK CANARY, BOOSTER GOLD, BATMAN, MISTER MIRACLE, GUY GARDNER, and ROCKET RED.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “The *really* big time.”\n\n**Panel Five**\nNathaniel, in his uniform, is hugging his daughter, PEGGY EILING. His son RANDY EILING is standing further away, arms folded.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “Even linked back up with his kids. That was around the time things started to fall apart.”\n\n**PAGE FOUR – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nALEC ROIS, alias THE GHOST is standing in the background, arms thrown wide and energy flashing behind him. Captain Atom is facing him in the foreground, ready for a fight.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “Suddenly, all of the General’s old *pals* from the Green Elite were coming out of the woodwork. The worst of them was *Rois.* ‘The Ghost’.”\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on a handwritten list of names:\n* ~~Lester Bryant~~\n* Wade Eiling\n* ~~Colin Lemar~~\n* ~~Martin Lockleed~~\n* Rako\n* Alec Rois\n* Trang\n* Henry Yarrow\n\n1.

Eiling is shooting HENRY YARROW through the head. The Ghost laughs in the background and we see the edge of Captain Atom’s head in the foreground.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “The General and the Ghost were still buddies at first. They set up *Henry Yarrow* as a patsy to look like the head of the frameup. Then got *rid* of him before he could say much else.”\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe list again.\n* ~~Lester Bryant~~\n* Wade Eiling\n* ~~Colin Lemar~~\n* ~~Martin Lockleed~~\n* Rako\n* Alec Rois\n* ~~Trang~~\n* ~~Henry Yarrow~~\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “Rois kept working, though. He turned against Eiling and began building a private army from his own personal cult.”\n\n**Panel Five**\nThe Ghost is disintegrating into a field of energy in front of Captain Atom while Eiling kneels near Megala in the background.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “To make a long story short, the General and the Captain struck back, Rois died, and he took Megala with him.”\n\n**Panel Six**\nCaptain Atom is standing at a lectern, speaking.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “The Captain confessed to his false background on national television and walked right out of the project. We haven’t seen him since.”\n\n**PAGE FIVE – SPLASH**\nA high angle on the PENTAGON. It’s early morning.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “And that’s the long and the short of it. At least, until… *recent* events.”\n\n2. UNKNOWN 2: (Cap) “Not quite. Do you know where Captain Atom is now?”\n\n3. UNKNOWN 1: (Cap) “No.”\n\n4.

TITLE: THE KING IS DEAD PART I – SINCE YESTERDAY\n\n**PAGE SIX – THREE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh establishing shot of a tiny town, laid out across the gentle slope of an otherwise wooded mountain. It’s mid-morning.\n\n1. LOCATOR CAPTION: Hillside, Pennsylvania.\n\n2. LOCATOR CAPTION: Population: 103 as of the last Census.\n\n3. LOCATOR CAPTION: Most profitable business: The rest stop on the Turnpike, three miles away.\n\n4. UNKNOWN 3: (From a particular house on the largest street) -So there he is, driving home with the cat food, right?\n\n**Panel Two**\nZoom in. We’re looking at the main street. It certainly hasn’t been repaved at any point in the current millennium, and probably not in the latter twenty or thirty years of the previous one.\n\n1. LOCATOR CAPTION: Hillside Avenue. Hillside, Pennsylvania.\n\n2. UNKNOWN 3: (From the same house) And suddenly, whoosh! A *deer* rushes out in front of him.\n\n**Panel Three**\nZoom in on the house. It’s small, but better maintained than the street itself. The lawn could use mowing, though.\n\n1. LOCATOR CAPTION: The Hill residence.\n\n2. UNKNOWN 3: (We now see that the bubble is actually coming from *behind* the house) He swerves, and his old jalopy goes right off the edge of the cliff. *Huge* crash.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nA man in coveralls has his head buried in a fusebox on the outside of the house.\n\n1. MAN IN COVERALLS: He crawls out of what’s left of his car, and who does he see but the Grim Reaper, right?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on the man. He’s leaned back out from the box. He has white hair and a short beard, but looks far too young for it, no older than his mid-thirties.\n\n1. MAN IN COVERALLS: Right, Mister Hill?\n\n**Panel Three**\nFull shot of a very old man in a folding chair on the back patio of the house. He’s clearly asleep.\n\n1. MAN IN COVERALLS: (Off-panel) Mason? You still with me over there?\n\n**Panel Four**\nMASON wakes with a start.\n\n1. MASON: (SFX: Snort) Wuh? Huh? Oh, sure thing, Jeff.\n\n**Panel Five**\nJEFF has his head in the fuse box again.\n\n1. JEFF: So like I was saying, he sees the Grim Reaper. And he says “Stop! Wait a minute. I’m a chess player. Don’t you let it slide if somebody can beat you at chess?”\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot from inside the box. Jeff is scratching his beard.\n\n1. JEFF: So, the Grim Reaper gets out a chess board, but this isn’t any *normal* chess board. It’s got twice the squares and twice the pieces.\n\n2. JEFF: Well, our guy didn’t think this was going to be *easy,* so he shrugs and starts playing. Ambulance comes, picks him up, he’s still there playing with the Reaper in the back.\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – SEVEN PANELS**\nTwo rows of two, and then the final three panels are full-width.\n\n**Panel One**\nJeff is returning his tools to a toolbox.\n\n1. JEFF: And this game just keeps going *on.* Then finally, five days later in the hospital, he *finally* checkmates the Reaper.\n\n**Panel Two**\nJeff is leaning against the wall behind Mason, holding his toolbox.\n\n1. JEFF: He says “Ha! I *got* you! Now I won’t die!” That sort of thing.\n\n2. JEFF: And the Reaper just looks at him and says “You?! I was here for the cat!”\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Mason, staring blankly.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle.\n\n1. MASON: … Huh?\n\n2. JEFF: (Off-panel) See, because he never brought back the- Ah, never mind. Power should be back on for you, Mister Hill.\n\n**Panel Five**\nA beat-up pickup trundles down a gravel road towards another small house, this one further up the mountain from the rest of the town. We still see the town in the background, but only distantly.\n\n**Panel Six**\nJeff is walking through a two-car garage. In the background, the pickup is parked in the driveway. The garage itself is too full to actually accommodate the vehicle. One side is full of tools, a mix of standard household tools and electrician’s equipment. The other is occupied by several long tables with model airplanes arrayed across them. Jeff has paused next to the wreckage of the P-38 Lightning from DCW: Alpha.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nCloseup on the Lightning as Jeff picks up a biplane in the background.\n\n**PAGE NINE – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup of the model biplane flying. A particularly well-informed reader might note it to be a SPAD S.XIII fighter.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 4: (Off-panel) Let’s hear another one!\n\n2. JEFF: (Off-panel) Alright, alright. This friend of mine is afraid of heights, right?\n\n**Panel Two**\nFour cars, including Jeff’s pickup, are parked along the edge of a clearing. Five people are leaning against the cars, holding controllers: DELL, Jeff, FRANK, BOB, and JACKIE. The latter two seem to have arrived in the same vehicle. Dell is throwing an empty water bottle at Jeff’s head.\n\n1. DELL: You already told that one! The skydiver, right?\n\n2. JEFF: All right, all right. I’ve got a new one I tried out on Mason this morning. Don’t think he got it, but I’m not sure if it’s a dud or he was just out of it.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from deeper in the woods. A silhouette in the foreground is watching the gathering.\n\n1. JEFF: So, a couple years back, I visited this guy I knew from high school. Real nerdy guy, too. President of the chess club.\n\n2. FRANK: Hey, Jeff, was this “friend” *you?*\n\n3. JEFF: Me? I don’t know a bull’s head from an en passant.\n\n4. BOB: A *what?*\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe same angle, but the silhouette is gone.\n\n1. JEFF: So anyway, I show up at this guy’s house, and his garage door is open. And in there, the whole thing is full of piles and piles of cat food!\n\n**PAGE TEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of one, a row of three, and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe’re still in the clearing, but it’s sunset. The same people are there, but they’ve moved around a bit. Jeff is kneeling next to his biplane in the foreground.\n\n1. CAPTION: Later.\n\n2. JEFF: Well, *something* threw off the balance.\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup on the propeller. It’s broken, one of the blades nearly fallen off. Jeff’s thumb is at the edge of the panel.\n\n**Panel Three**\nJeff is holding the propeller in place and running his thumb along the break. The tip of his thumb is covered in a shiny red substance and a faint glow emanates from beneath it.\n\n**Panel Four**\nThe blade is repaired, with only a thin, faintly glowing seam suggesting it was ever broken.\n\n1. JEFF: (Off-panel) Huh. Can’t tell what was wrong with it. Looks fine now, anyway.\n\n**Panel Five**\nBack out to a two-shot as Dell walks over.\n\n1. DELL: Hey, what happened to your Lightning? I liked that one.\n\n2. JEFF: Aw, got stupid and ran it into a tree. ‘Swhy I get nervous about flying *this* baby most of the time.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe same angle. Jeff is turning back towards the others.\n\n1. JEFF: Hey, did I ever tell you the one about the ace who lost his propeller?\n\n2. JACKIE: You never ask that unless you *have* told it.\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nThe sun is almost entirely down. The group is packing up their planes.\n\n1. JEFF: -And the bartender says “Who let that *beagle* in here?!”\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot of Bob and Jackie getting in their car.\n\n1. JACKIE: You’re impossible, Jeff.\n\n2. BOB: Where do you *hear* these jokes?\n\n**Panel Three**\nJeff is climbing into his car.\n\n1. JEFF: I’ve… been around.\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot of the pickup driving up the road to Jeff’s house. It’s completely dark now.\n\n**Panel Five**\nAnother shot past the silhouette, this time from inside the house, watching the car pull up the driveway.\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – EIGHT PANELS**\nTwo-by-four grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot of the window from behind Jeff as he gets out of the car.\n\n1. JEFF: (Cap) My shadow thinks I haven’t noticed him.\n\n**Panel Two**\nJeff carries the S.XIII into the garage.\n\n1. JEFF: (Cap) I didn’t *disillusion* him because my friends were around.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on him kneeling down and opening a plastic tote under one of the long tables.\n\n1. JEFF: (Cap) Figure he probably cut out early to wait for me here.\n\n**Panel Four**\nExtreme closeup. Jeff has stood up and turned around, and we see his hands. He’s loading a HANDGUN.\n\n1. SFX: CLACK\n\n**Panel Five**\nAngle from behind Jeff as he steps through the door into a mudroom.\n\n**Panel Six**\nHigh angle as he steps out of the mudroom into a small kitchen. He has his weapon raised but not pointed.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nThe same angle. He’s approaching an open doorway leading into another room. A crumpled piece of paper is lying on the ground.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nOver-the-shoulder shot of Jeff opening up the paper to look at it. It contains a poorly filled-in crossword puzzle.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – EIGHT PANELS**\nTwo-by-four grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nStill following Jeff’s glance from over his shoulder, but now he’s looking up through the doorway. On the other side is a small office. A dark-haired man in a blue trench coat is inside, facing away from Jeff. His feet are propped on the desk and he’s holding paper in his hand.\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup on the gun, with the back of the intruder’s head at the edge of the panel.\n\n1. JEFF: (Off-panel) Hands up, pal.\n\n2. ?: (Off-panel) Can it wait? I’ve almost got this Sudoku grid cracked.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from behind Jeff, reaching to grab the intruder by the shoulder.\n\n1. JEFF: Look, I don’t care who sent you or why, but-\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack to the closeup on the gun. The intruder’s head is gone and instead his gloved hand is striking Jeff’s wrist, causing him to drop the gun.\n\n**Panel Five**\nShot from the desk. Jeff is taking a swing at the intruder with his left hand as the intruder ducks underneath in a low tackle.\n\n1. JEFF: (Cap) Got too close. Amateur move.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Jeff. His knee is raised, apparently trying to knee the intruder, but the intruder, face in silhouette, has already moved around behind him and caught him in a chokehold.\n\n1. JEFF: (Cap) Wasting time. I know my way around close combat, but this joker’s an expert.\n\n2. JEFF: (Cap) Not much of a secret to keep at this point.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nPull out a little. Jeff’s hand, enveloped in the same red substance from before is reaching back and grabbing the intruder’s face. Blue light is flashing from beneath the hand.\n\n1. ?: AHHH!\n\n2. JEFF: (Cap) Should just be enough to knock him flat.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nThe intruder is reeling, clutching his face with both hands.\n\n1. ?: M-my face!\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – SPLASH**\nThe intruder removes his hands, revealing that he has no face at all!\n\n1. ?: My God, ***YOU’VE BURNED MY FACE OFF!***\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Jeff, his arms folded and one eyebrow raised.\n\n1. ?: (Off-panel) Hey, it was worth a shot. Will you stop trying to kill me now?\n\n**Panel Two**\nTwo-shot of Jeff and the intruder.\n\n1. JEFF: I was *never* trying to kill you. Just get you out of my *house.* Tell *Eiling* that I’m not interested.\n\n2. ?: I’m not from Eiling.\n\n3. JEFF: Fine. Waller. Steel. Stein. Faraday. Hell, Max or J’onn or whoever’s running the League right now. I don’t care. I’m not interested.\n\n4. ?: Wrong, six times over. That’s got to be some kind of record.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot over the intruder’s shoulder.\n\n1. JEFF: You’re missing the part where I don’t believe you and wouldn’t care if I did.\n\n2. ?: Fair enough. Let’s pretend, then. Let’s pretend I’m a free agent. Let’s pretend I’m maybe four hours ahead of the people you’re talking about at best, and that I spent three and a half of them watching you play with little airplanes. Let’s pretend I’m here in your best interests.\n\n**Panel Four**\nMirror that shot, now over Jeff’s shoulder at the intruder.\n\n1. JEFF: You’ve got a very active imagination. Anything *else* we’re pretending?\n\n2. ?: Can we pretend that I could go for some coffee?\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – NINE PANELS**\nThree-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nJeff and the intruder are sitting across from each other at the kitchen table, coffee mugs in front of them.\n\n1. JEFF: *Who* did you say you were?\n\n2. ?: I didn’t.\n\n3. JEFF: Thanks.\n\n4. ?: You’re welcome!\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on the intruder, eyeing his coffee cup and scratching at the part of his face where his mouth should be.\n\n1. ?: Hm… I didn’t think this through very well.\n\n2. JEFF: (Off-panel) Have you thought through telling me just what the hell you’re *doing* here?\n\n3. ?: Look, Major- Do you prefer Major Adam or Major Scott?\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on Jeff, looking agitated.\n\n1. JEFF: “Mister Randall” will do.\n\n2. ?: (Off-panel) And I thought *I* had too many names.\n\n3. JEFF: None of which you’ll tell me.\n\n4. ?: (Off-panel) Now you’re getting it.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on the intruder. He can’t show much expression, of course, but the inker should render the shadows on his face a little deeper and darker.\n\n1. ?: Listen to me.\n\n2. ?: In a short while, some of those government spooks you’re so afraid of are going to show up, and Mister Jeffrey H. Randall, professional electrician, is going to have to become Major Cameron Scott, secret superhero. And when that happens?\n\n**Panel Five**\nExtreme closeup on the intruder.\n\n1. ?: ***Don’t. Trust. Anyone.***\n\n**Panel Six**\nProfile shot on Jeff.\n\n1. JEFF: Including you?\n\n**Panel Seven**\nProfile shot on the intruder.\n\n1. ?: Including me. I’m here because I suspect *I* can trust *you.* *Someone* is playing games, but I can barely identify the players. When you get involved, maybe you can give me a clearer picture of the board.\n\n**Panel Eight**\nExtreme closeup on Jeff.\n\n1. JEFF: What makes you think I’ll get involved?\n\n**Panel Nine**\nExtreme closeup on the intruder.\n\n1. ?: What makes you think you’ll have a *choice?*\n\n2. SFX: Knock! Knock! Knock!\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nRow of tall, thin panels.\n\n**Panel One**\nJeff and the intruder have sprung to their feet.\n\n1. JEFF: Friends of yours?\n\n2. ?: No. Friends of *yours.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nJeff begins to walk past the intruder towards the door.\n\n1. JEFF: I don’t suppose you plan to join me?\n\n2. ?: No, I plan to disappear mysteriously while you aren’t looking.\n\n3. JEFF: I guess that figures.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot of the front door.\n\n1. SFX: Knock! Knock! Knock!\n\n**Panel Four**\nJeff gets to the door and starts opening it.\n\n1. JEFF: Right, right, I’m coming-\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of one, a row of two, and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over Jeff’s shoulder. Outside is a man about his age in an Air Force dress uniform. This is MARTIN ALLARD.\n\n1. JEFF: -Allard?!\n\n2. ALLARD: Evening, Major Scott.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Jeff, looking very angry.\n\n1. JEFF: No. You’ve got the wrong guy.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from outside. Jeff is trying to slam the door shut and Allard is blocking it with his foot.\n\n1. ALLARD: Be *reasonable,* Scott.\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack inside. Allard has forced his way through the door, and Jeff is backing up defensively.\n\n1. JEFF: Whatever it is, Captain Allard, I’m *not interested.*\n\n2. ALLARD: I think you will be. And it’s *Colonel* Allard now.\n\n3. JEFF: And I’m supposed to be impressed?\n\n4. ALLARD: It’s been a long five years, Major Scott.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Jeff. He whirls and points at Allard.\n\n1. JEFF: Not *nearly* long enough.\n\n**Panel Six**\nAllard is scratching his head, looking genuinely concerned.\n\n1. ALLARD: Look, Scott. Cameron. *Nathaniel.* We *need* you on this one. And I think you’ll *want* a crack at it.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – TWO PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nJeff has folded his arms again.\n\n1. JEFF: OK. Fine. I’ll bite. What’s so important that it’s going to draw me back into Eiling’s little cloak-and-dagger game of my own free will?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Allard.\n\n1. ALLARD: It’s not his game anymore, Scott. The General has been *murdered.*\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – SPLASH**\nFull shot of Jeff. He’s transformed into the metallic form of Captain Atom. Energy crackles around him, almost entirely obscuring the background.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: All right.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: You have my attention.\n\n3.

Approaching the reader is a GIANT ROBOT SHAPED LIKE A SPIDER. It’s covered in laser turrets and buzz saws and other nasty doodads. Bystanders flee in terror as it rampages down the street.\n\n1. BYSTANDER: My God, *it’s heading right for the school!*\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) Not if *I* have anything to stay about it.\n\n3. TITLE: THE KING IS DEAD PART II – SECRETS AND ROBOTS\n\n**PAGE TWO – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe see CAPTAIN ATOM, standing in front of a school, which bears a sign helpfully marked “SCHOOL.” He’s pointing dramatically, presumably at the giant spiderbot.\n\n1. BYSTANDER: (Off-panel) *Captain Atom!*\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: You’re about to get *squished,* Arachnotron!\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup as Captain Atom flies at the Arachnotron.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: And *I’m* the *tissue!*\n\n**Panel Three**\nWide shot. He’s punching the Arachnotron, which reels.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: You’re a threat *and* a menace!\n\n**Panel Four**\nWhat appears to be a net made of electricity is wrapping around Captain Atom.\n\n1. CAPTION: Suddenly, Captain Atom is ensnared by the Arachnotron’s deadly *techno-web!*\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: Great Scott! I’ve been ensnared by the Arachnotron’s deadly *techno-web!*\n\n3. UNKNOWN: (From off-page entirely, crossing over the panel border) Uh, that’s great, Matthews, but there’s just one problem.\n\n**PAGE THREE – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nKURT MATTHEWS, a well-dressed but somewhat nerdy-looking young man, is standing in front of an easel with the previous page drawn on it. He’s pointing at the last panel. The setting is a cramped but otherwise comfortable-looking airplane, possibly a private jet of some sort.\n\n1. LOCATOR CAPTION: Over Maryland.\n\n2. MATTHEWS: All right, so the dialogue needs a lot of work, but the general concept is sound.\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe get a reverse shot at Jeff, or rather, NATHANIEL. He’s armored up one of his arms and is shaving using his reflection in the silvery surface. Half of his beard is gone and he’s gesticulating with the razor. COLONEL ALLARD is in a seat nearby.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: Sound? You call releasing an *actual* killer robot in the middle of a city “sound?” Never thought I’d miss *Theresa.* *\n\n2. MATTHEWS: Well, for your big comeback-\n\n3. NATHANIEL: I’m *certain* I can find a *real* supervillain if I put my mind to it.\n\n4. CAPTION: * Theresa Delgado, the PR expert who created Captain Atom’s original false backstory.\n\n**Panel Three**\nTwo-shot. Allard has stood up and put a hand on Nathaniel’s shoulder and Nathaniel is now pointing at him.\n\n1. ALLARD: Captain, please-\n\n2. NATHANIEL: I’m *not* here to be your stooge. I’m here to investigate Eiling’s death. That’s *it.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nAllard turns away and throws his hands up. Nathaniel goes back to shaving.\n\n1. ALLARD: Fine! Fine. But we may well need Captain Atom back in the field full-time to ferret this thing out.\n\n2. NATHANIEL: And you’ve *got* him. But I’m consulting here. On *my* terms.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Nathaniel. He’s looking over his shoulder. More, but not all, of the beard is gone.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: Incidentally, Allard, the last time I saw you, you were on a quantum-powered rampage. What happened to *Ironfire?*\n\n**Panel Six**\nShot past Nathaniel’s shoulder at Allard, sitting back down and smirking knowingly.\n\n1. ALLARD: That’s classified, Captain.\n\n2. NATHANIEL: (Off-panel) How’d I guess you were about to say that?\n\n**PAGE FOUR – SEVEN PANELS**\nA row of one and two rows of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nHigh angle on the PENTAGON.\n\n1. LOCATOR CAPTION: Arlington.\n\n2. NATHANIEL: (Cap) “It happened *here?*”\n\n3. ALLARD: (Cap) “In one of the most secure facilities on the planet? Yes. Stumper, isn’t it?”\n\n**Panel Two**\nNathaniel and Allard are walking down a hallway. Several others in military uniforms are shuffling around.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: Talk about a locked room mystery. You don’t need Captain Atom; you need *Batman.*\n\n2. ALLARD: We, ah, don’t mention certain classes of airborne mammal in the Program these days.\n\n3. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) You can’t stonewall me like this!\n\n4. NATHANIEL: Who-?\n\n**Panel Three**\nWe see SARGE STEEL, dressed in a worn-out grey suit, pointing angrily with his robotic hand at one of a pair of MPs standing guard outside a door in the hallway. A cigar is clenched between his teeth.\n\n1. MP 1: This *is* a military affair, Director Steel.\n\n2. STEEL: You mean a military *coverup.*\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot from the other side as Allard and Nathaniel approach. Steel is turning to face them. He’s holding the cigar and while he’s facing away from us, his body language indicates surprise.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: And you *know* coverups, don’t you, Steel?\n\n2. STEEL: My division’s operations are *no* concern of- SCOTT?!\n\n**Panel Five**\nSteel and Nathaniel shake hands. Steel looks like he’s seen a ghost and Nathaniel is frowning. Allard is behind Nathaniel, looking even more sour, while the MPs at the door behind Steel remain impassive.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: I know, I know, I’m dead or retired or something. Didn’t stick around long enough to learn what excuse they picked.\n\n2. STEEL: Hell, I never believed *anything* Eiling told me, but if they’re bringing you *back* there *must* be something fishy going on here.\n\n3. ALLARD: That’s *enough*, Steel. This is outside your jurisdiction.\n\n**Panel Six**\nSteel is stalking off down the hallway, pointing his cigar at Allard as he and Nathaniel approach the door.\n\n1. STEEL: You haven’t heard the *last* of this, Allard!\n\n2. ALLARD: I’m sure.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nShot of the door from inside. We don’t see much of the room. Allard is leading Nathaniel in.\n\n1. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) That had better be you, Allard, and you’d better have the Captain with you.\n\n2. UNKNOWN: (Off-panel) And if not, *leave* before I *shoot* something.\n\n3. ALLARD: It’s me, ma’am.\n\n4. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) “Ma’am?” I assumed Allard was *running* this show.\n\n**PAGE FIVE – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over Nathaniel’s shoulder. The office is sparse and windowless, clearly barely used. A desk stands in the middle. Behind it, an overturned chair. There is no body, but a bullet hole in the wall behind the desk suggests this is where the murder occurred. A woman with a long coat and a blonde ponytail is leaning over the desk, facing away from the door, staring intently at a disturbed pile of papers. A handgun lies next to her right hand.\n\n1. ALLARD: And I *did* bring, ah, Major Scott. As requested.\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on the woman as she turns to face them. Now that we have a look at her face, we can see that she’s perhaps in her late twenties.\n\n1. ARMSTRONG: Of course you did. Otherwise you’d have left before I shot you.\n\n2. ARMSTRONG: ‘Morning, Major. My name is Armstrong. I’m in charge.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from the side so we can see both Nathaniel and Armstrong. Allard is off to the side. The last line overlaps onto the next panel.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: Define “in charge.”\n\n2. ARMSTRONG: “In charge.” Adjective. Having the capacity to lodge the intelligence community’s collective boot up your rectal cavity if you don’t watch your tone.\n\n3. ALLARD: Agent Armstrong is an… inter-agency counterintelligence specialist.\n\n4. NATHANIEL: A sort of *Spy Smasher,* I suppose.\n\n**Panel Four**\nSomewhat wider shot of Armstrong than the last closeup, giving us a better view of her clothes. Under her coat is a green uniform bearing a black diamond outlined in red, indeed the symbol of SPY SMASHER.\n\n1. ARMSTRONG: Well, at least *somebody* around here did his homework. Now, you’re Captain Atom, Allard is Eiling’s favorite toady, and Eiling’s a corpse. That should cover the pleasantries.\n\n**PAGE SIX – FIVE PANELS**\nA splash, but the bottom half or so is covered by four insets. Those four are roughly in a grid, but have off-kilter angles and proportions.\n\n**Panel One**\nArmstrong turns back to the desk. We look past her at Nathaniel.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: Which brings me to my next questions: How’d he die, and what are you asking *me* to do about it?\n\n2. ARMSTRONG: @#&!$%, didn’t you *brief* him, Allard?\n\n3. ALLARD: I thought you’d want-\n\n4. ARMSTRONG: You’re trying to *think* now? That’s new.\n\n**Panel Two**\nWe’re now looking down at the papers on the desk. Armstrong’s hand is reaching into the panel to gesture at them. Some look like formal reports while others are printouts and newspaper clippings bearing information about superheroes.\n\n1. ARMSTRONG: Before he croaked, the General was conducting an investigation of his own. The way I see it, we solve *his* case, we solve *our* case.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on a report on MAXWELL LORD, which features his picture.\n\n1. ARMSTRONG: (Off-panel) I’m sure you’re familiar with Max Lord. After his Justice League shut down, he’s been building a *new* pet superhero team on another old brand.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on a photocopy of an old newspaper article. It features the headline “UNCLE SAM AND THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS” and a photo of the Freedom Fighters, including UNCLE SAM, the RAY, the PHANTOM LADY, DOLL MAN, the HUMAN BOMB, and BLACK CONDOR. They’re running at the reader.\n\n1. ARMSTRONG: (Off-panel) How much do you know about the Freedom Fighters?\n\n2. NATHANIEL: (Off-panel) *Really* old team. Fought the Axis, right? Organized by Uncle Sam – supposedly not a metaphor or a codename, but *literally* Uncle Sam himself.\n\n3. ARMSTRONG: (Off-panel) Right again. Regular teacher’s pet, aren’t you?\n\n**Panel Five**\nAnother closeup. We see a printout of a more modern article. This time the headline is “DOLL MAN, LORD ANNOUNCE NEW FREEDOM FIGHTERS.” The photo shows Lord shaking hands with Doll Man.\n\n1. ARMSTRONG: (Off-panel) Lord’s setting up a new iteration in partnership with Doll Man – theoretically the original, but damned *spry* for his age if he is.\n\n**PAGE SEVEN – FIVE PANELS**\nTwo rows of one and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nPulling back out. Nathaniel is looking over Armstrong’s shoulder at the papers.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: And we don’t *know* what Eiling’s interest in these guys was?\n\n2. ARMSTRONG: Lord’s been cozying up to some of the shadier agencies in town. Eiling *seems* to have thought there’s a connection. I have some irons in the fire on that end, which leaves *you.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Nathaniel. He’s backing up and folding his arms.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: I’m supposed to lean on these new Freedom Fighters?\n\n2. ARMSTRONG: (Off-panel) Don’t be absurd. *I* could do *that.* In my *sleep.* You’re supposed to *join* them.\n\n**Panel Three**\nNathaniel is turning and gesturing to Allard.\n\n1. NATHANIEL: Which I suppose is the reason for my big comeback appearance.\n\n2. ALLARD: Does that mean you’ll *do* it?\n\n3. NATHANIEL: Hell no.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Armstrong, leaning against the desk and pinching the bridge of her nose.\n\n1. ARMSTRONG: Be *reasonable,* Major. We went to all the trouble of building a special killer robot *just for you* and you’re upset because you want a *real* killer robot?\n\n2. NATHANIEL: (Off-panel) … ***Yes!***\n\n**Panel Five**\nA man in a suit is bursting through the door.\n\n1. MAN IN SUIT: Agent Armstrong! Unit A-66 has escaped from Facility 2!\n\n**PAGE EIGHT – TWO PANELS**\nA splash and an inset in the bottom right.\n\n**Panel One**\nBack to the high angle on the Pentagon, but this time, the foreground is taken up by CAPTAIN ATOM, flying out of a window. Energy crackles around him and the midday sun reflects almost blindingly off of his metallic skin.\n\n**Panel Two**\nAllard is starting to walk out the door, but turning back towards Armstrong, who’s smirking knowingly.\n\n1. ALLARD: *That* was good timing.\n\n2. ARMSTRONG: It *was,* wasn’t it?\n\n**PAGE NINE – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of one and two rows of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nA hulking humanoid robot made of black metal is marching down a Washington street. Several police officers are shooting at it from behind a barricade to no effect as bystanders flee in terror. Viewers of Justice League Unlimited may recognize the ANNIHILATOR. The view is a little tighter, but the framing isn’t dissimilar to the Arachnotron splash from the first page.\n\n1. LOCATOR CAPTION: Washington, D.C.\n\n2. OFFICER 1: Nothing *stops* this thing!\n\n3. OFFICER 2: Where the hell is *Wonder Woman?!* Didn’t she take it down the first time?\n\n4. OFFICER 3: I thought it was those Hawk and Dove kids…\n\n**Panel Two**\nAt a Dutch angle, we see Captain Atom streak in and punch the Annihilator across the faceplate. It shifts backwards, but we see no actual damage.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) Thing is *tough.* What’s it *made* out of?\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull in closer. The Annihilator lashes out at Captain Atom with its arm. The movement is stiff and awkward, but the blow is clearly powerful, as the Captain is sent sprawling through the air.\n\n**Panel Four**\nOur view turns to watch Captain Atom as he’s flying through a glass storefront of a clothing store.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Captain Atom with a hand on the counter, pulling himself to his feet.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) So *that’s* how we’re playing this, huh?\n\n**PAGE TEN – THREE PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide, low angle. A beam of energy is lancing out of the store and striking the Annihilator in the chest. The Annihilator is stepping forward, unfazed.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) Unreal. Beam this intensity could slice through Promethium like *butter.*\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot over Captain Atom’s shoulder. He’s still pouring on the heat and the Annihilator is now rearing back to punch him.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) Something’s not-\n\n**Panel Three**\nHigh angle on the store. It’s collapsing in on itself from a shockwave inside.\n\n1. SFX: DOOM!\n\n**PAGE ELEVEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nCaptain Atom is lying in the rubble. Four glowing scratches (roughly the same distance apart as the Annihilator’s knuckles) run from his left shoulder down across his chest. Sparks are spitting from the openings. Captain Atom is conscious, barely.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) It’s actually getting *stronger.* How…?\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe Annihilator has lifted Captain Atom up by the torso and is trying to crush him.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) *Think,* Adam. Thing’s *got* to have a power source.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCloseup on the Annihilator’s faceplate as Captain Atom clamps his hands on either side of its head.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) Which means… I can…\n\n**Panel Four**\nBack out to the two shot. The lights in the Annihilator’s faceplate are fading, but Captain Atom is writhing, red light pouring from his eyes and mouth.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) … ***Drain it!***\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: AAAAHHHH!\n\n**PAGE TWELVE – SIX PANELS**\nTwo-by-three grid.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot over Captain Atom’s shoulder. The Annihilator has fallen dark, its arms now hanging limp at its sides.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) Normally when I absorb a lot of energy, the feeling is… crisp. Electric. Somewhere between an adrenaline rush and a static shock.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) But right now?\n\n**Panel Two**\nExtreme closeup on Captain Atom’s eyes. They’re crackling with red energy.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) I’m just *%!$$#& off.*\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe street becomes a hazy blur in the background as Captain Atom takes off into the sky, snarling.\n\n**Panel Four**\nLandscape shot of the surface of the moon.\n\n**Panel Five**\nA reddish-orange streak descends in the distance, causing an explosion.\n\n**Panel Six**\nThe terrain warps, cracks, and crumbles under an intense shockwave as the sky adopts a hazy red tinge.\n\n**PAGE THIRTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of one, a row of two, and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nWide shot. Captain Atom is kneeling in the middle of a *massive* crater. Debris is still falling around him.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) Magic.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) I *hate* magic.\n\n**Panel Two**\nLow shot of him taking off.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) Should probably get planetside before I run out of *breath.*\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe police officers are nervously approaching the Annihilator.\n\n1. UNKNOWN 3: (Off-panel) Stay back!\n\n**Panel Four**\nShot past the police officers. A series of afterimages show Doll Man growing from six inches to full size as he leaps in front of the collapsed robot.\n\n1. DOLL MAN: Nobody make any aggressive moves! It literally *runs* on violence!\n\n2. OFFICER 2: *The Atom!*\n\n3. OFFICER 3: (Whispering) Ain’t that the guy what was just here?\n\n4. DOLL MAN: (SFX: Sigh) No, I am *not* the Atom. Doll Man at your service, Officers.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on Doll Man speaking into a communicator.\n\n1. DOLL MAN: Doll Man to Fighters. Area’s secure already.\n\n2. DOLL MAN: No clue.\n\n**Panel Six**\nLow angle as Captain Atom comes in for a landing.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: Afraid that was me. Wish I’d known how the thing works *before* I tried to fry it.\n\n2. UNKNOWN 4: (Off-panel) You did an impressive job as it was, Captain.\n\n3. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) *That’s* a familiar voice.\n\n**PAGE FOURTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nA vertical stack, with the fourth panel inset in the third.\n\n**Panel One**\nCaptain Atom hasn’t finished landing, instead hovering. He’s looking off to the side and we’re following his glance. In the background, FIRE is approaching in her flaming form, followed by BLACK CONDOR, who is telekinetically carrying the HUMAN BOMB.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: Bea! I can’t say I was expecting to run into *you.*\n\n2. FIRE: You’re one to talk, Captain. After *your* exit, we all thought we’d seen the last of you.\n\n**Panel Two**\nTwo shot. The two touch down and Fire shuts off her flames.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: First day back on the job. A doozy, too. Nearly blew up the moon venting all the rage I absorbed from our *friend* over there.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: Hey, aren’t you going to introduce me?\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe other three Freedom Fighters form up behind Fire. Her first three speech bubbles fall over their heads.\n\n1. FIRE: I see you’ve met Doll Man, but these are…\n\n2. DOLL MAN: *Not* the Atom.\n\n3. FIRE: … The Human Bomb…\n\n4. HUMAN BOMB: (SFX: Mmf)\n\n5. FIRE: … And the Black Condor.\n\n6. BLACK CONDOR: Captain.\n\n7. FIRE: We’re the new Freedom Fighters.\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Captain Atom and Fire. They’re both smiling.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: Which Freedom Fighter are *you?*\n\n2. FIRE: Haven’t heard *that* one before. For the record, we’re counting me as *Firebrand.* She was at least active around the same time and place as the original team.\n\n**PAGE FIFTEEN – FOUR PANELS**\nGrid.\n\n**Panel One**\nFire is pointing at the Annihilator as Black Condor approaches it.\n\n1. FIRE: Condor, get the Annihilator back into containment. *Carefully.*\n\n2. BLACK CONDOR: Got it.\n\n3. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Off-panel) I take it you’re in charge of this outfit?\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Fire, shrugging.\n\n1. FIRE: Well, Max is. We couldn’t find Uncle Sam, and Max knows me, so that makes me field leader.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot over Doll Man’s shoulder. He’s scratching his chin and looking at Captain Atom appraisingly. Fire is also visible.\n\n1. DOLL MAN: You know, down an Uncle as we are, we could *use* a patriotic powerhouse.\n\n2. FIRE: Agreed. Unless you had other plans…?\n\n3. CAPTAIN ATOM: I’d… be honored.\n\n4. CAPTAIN ATOM: (Cap) *Played* is a better word. This is all fitting together a little *too* neatly.\n\n**Panel Four**\nWide shot. Captain Atom, Fire, Doll Man, and the Human Bomb are walking out of the rubble.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: I don’t suppose you’ve got a Phantom Lady and a Ray?\n\n2. FIRE: Doll Man, the Bomb, and I started the team, and we only just picked up Condor.\n\n3. DOLL MAN: There *is* a new Ray; we’ve just had some trouble actually getting a *hold* of the guy.\n\n4. FIRE: And Max says he’s finalizing a *special* arrangement for the Phantom Lady.\n\n5. DOLL MAN: In short—and I *know* short—what you see is what you get.\n\n**PAGE SIXTEEN – SIX PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two. The last panel is inset into the bottom right corner.\n\n**Panel One**\nTwo-shot of Captain Atom next to Fire. She looks surprised.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: Incidentally, you’re the first of the old group I’ve run into since I’ve been back. You still in touch with any of the others? How’s Ice?\n\n2. FIRE: Um…\n\n**Panel Two**\nCloseup on Fire, looking past Captain Atom’s head. Nathaniel’s clearly just opened an old wound here.\n\n1. FIRE: I guess you wouldn’t have heard. Tora’s *dead,* Captain.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: I’m sorry. I know you were close.\n\n3. FIRE: It’s… in the past.\n\n**Panel Three**\nPull back out to see all four of them. Fire’s switching on her flames again.\n\n1. FIRE: In any case, we need to report back to Max. Since you’re interested in joining, you should probably tag along.\n\n2. DOLL MAN: (Speaking into his communicator) Condor? Dolly. The flyers are heading back to the Cabin. Bomb and I could use TK pickup.\n\n3. HUMAN BOMB: Mmf.\n\n**Panel Four**\nWe’re back in Eiling’s office. Allard is putting away a phone and turning to face Armstrong.\n\n1. ALLARD: They’re locking the Annihilator up in a S.T.A.R. facility.\n\n2. ARMSTRONG: I thought they would. Acceptable sacrifice.\n\n**Panel Five**\nAllard has his head tilted curiously to the side.\n\n1. ALLARD: Aren’t we stealing it back?\n\n2. ARMSTRONG: No, some moron is bound to set the thing off. Nobody died *this* time because I *planned* it that way, but I don’t have the same control over S.T.A.R.’s facility.\n\n**Panel Six**\nCloseup on Armstrong, looking thoughtful.\n\n1. ARMSTRONG: Though *maybe…*\n\n**PAGE SEVENTEEN – SEVEN PANELS**\nTwo rows of two and a row of three.\n\n**Panel One**\nShot between Captain Atom and Fire as they approach a sprawling mansion built into a wooded hillside. It’s built with a pseudo-rustic, wood-and-stone architectural style.\n\n1. LOCATOR CAPTION: Several miles west of Arlington.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: You call *this* the *Cabin?*\n\n3. FIRE: Max’s idea of a joke.\n\n4. CAPTAIN ATOM: I’m sure.\n\n**Panel Two**\nA sloped, wooden-shingled roof splits open as the two approach, revealing a high-tech landing pad beneath.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: Breaks my heart to see an empty landing pad.\n\n2. FIRE: We’re working on transportation.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe two are landing.\n\n1. MAX: (Off-panel) Well, *I’m* working on transportation.\n\n**Panel Four**\nLow angle on MAXWELL LORD. He’s standing in a doorway with his hands in the pockets of an expensive-looking grey double-breasted suit.\n\n1. MAX: I hope the *rest* of you are more focused on saving the world.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCaptain Atom approaches Max and shakes his hand.\n\n1. MAX: Gotta admit, Captain: When Bea called ahead about a visitor, I was *not* expecting you.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: It’s been a while, Mister Lord.\n\n3. MAX: Not so long you can’t call me Max, Cap.\n\n**Panel Six**\nMax turns to Fire.\n\n1. FIRE: How did things go with the Phantom Lady?\n\n2. MAX: Not bad. She’s actually here right now.\n\n3. FIRE: In the building?\n\n4. DISEMBODIED BUBBLE: (Off-panel) You’re pretty warm.\n\n**Panel Seven**\nThe PHANTOM LADY appears from thin air in the middle of the other three.\n\n1. PHANTOM LADY: But “Fire” might be pushing it a little.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: *That’s* a neat trick.\n\n3. PHANTOM LADY: It *is,* isn’t it?\n\n**PAGE EIGHTEEN – FIVE PANELS**\nA row of three and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nCloseup on Max.\n\n1. MAX: Well, now that we’re all acquainted…\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot of the Cabin from a distance. A silhouette is in the foreground.\n\n1. MAX: (From inside) How about I give you the grand tour?\n\n2. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: I see Armstrong already has you linked up with the Fighters.\n\n**Panel Three**\nThe same angle. The observer has moved forward and is looking over his shoulder. It’s the faceless stranger from the first issue.\n\n1. HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: If you were paying attention when we spoke in Hillside, you know not to trust her *or* them.\n\n**Panel Four**\nHe gets out a notepad and begins scribbling on it.\n\n1 HANDWRITTEN CAPTION: Here’s what *I* know.\n\n**Panel Five**\nCloseup on what he’s writing.\n* I don’t know who called down Armstrong or what her background is. All I know is that she’s exactly the all-powerful super-spook she claims to be.\n* I haven’t seen her minion *Lockwood* in a while. Watch out for that guy.\n* You know Allard. Whatever Eiling was doing, Allard was in on it.\n* Sarge Steel knows something I don’t. I don’t like that.\n* Lord’s always been shady in a used-car-salesman sort of way, but the only reason I have to think that there’s anything *more* sinister going on is that everyone *else* seems to. *That* worries me.\n* Fire’s interests seem aligned with Lord. He says “jump,” she jumps.\n* Doll Man – Why hasn’t he aged???\n* Human Bomb – Came out of nowhere. Background seems in order, but it’s sparse. Clean. Very fake.\n* Black Condor – Loner. Joining a team doesn’t add up. Why is he here?\n* Phantom Lady – Predecessor died under mysterious circumstances. *Very* mysterious.\n\n**PAGE NINETEEN – THREE PANELS**\nA row of one and a row of two.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe see the sheet lying on a nightstand in a bedroom. It’s well-appointed but doesn’t contain any personal effects, like a hotel room. Its last sheet is legible.\n\n1. NOTE: I’ll be in touch soon.\n\n2. NOTE: -?\n\n**Panel Two**\nThe angle changes, but the note is still in the foreground. The door is swinging open and we see Max and Captain Atom outside.\n\n1. MAX: If you don’t have a place, you’re welcome to stay at the Cabin. This room’s open.\n\n2. CAPTAIN ATOM: Thanks, Max.\n\n**Panel Three**\nCaptain Atom has entered the room and is looking suspiciously at the note.\n\n1. CAPTAIN ATOM: Hm.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY – FOUR PANELS**\nVertical stack.\n\n**Panel One**\nWe’re in the woods at night, under the light of a full moon. A young, brown-haired man in a black turtleneck is running through a mud puddle, panic in his eyes.\n\n1. LOCATOR CAPTION: Oregon.\n\n**Panel Two**\nShot from behind as the man scrambles up a steep hillside.\n\n1. SFX: (From off-panel) Tk-tk-tk-tk-TK!\n\n2. TURTLENECK MAN: (Whispering) Damn. Thought I’d lost them.\n\n**Panel Three**\nShot from the top of the slope. He’s kneeling and speaking into a wrist communicator.\n\n1. TURTLENECK MAN: (Whispering) Lockwood to base. Do you read?\n\n2. LOCKWOOD: (Whispering) Pick *up,* damn you.\n\n3. SFX: (From below) TK-TK-TK!\n\n**Panel Four**\nCloseup on Lockwood.\n\n1. LOCKWOOD: (Whispering) Situation has changed. Worse than before. Hell on Earth out here. Hostiles everywhere. Nowhere to run.\n\n**PAGE TWENTY-ONE – SPLASH**\nLockwood looks up and begins to stand, drawing a pistol. He’s still speaking into the communicator. However, numerous silhouettes are closing in around him. We only see them at the very edges of the page, but they’re, well, very *nearly* humanoid, but twisted and bent. We see a few wires.\n\n1. LOCKWOOD: We’re going to need some capes.\n\n2. SFX: (All around him) TK-TK-TK-TK-TK!","date":"2020-05-27T04:00:00.000Z","_id":"a809e0718e814404b6ddd2702215a357"}]
